### You might want to (re-)build the Docker image before:
#../build-env/rebuild-dev-image

../build-env/run-script          ./10-clear-targets
#../build-env/run-script          ./11-test
../build-env/run-script          ./12-make-targets
                                 ./15-make-docs
../build-env/run-script          ./17-make-deb-package
# The following starts its own Docker container:
                                 ./18-make-win-msi-package
../build-env/run-script          ./19-symlink-installer
../build-env/run-script          ./20-clear-targets-keep-binaries
