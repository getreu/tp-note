environments. It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes efficiently.
This tool is ideal for users looking for a simple yet powerful way to manage
their notes across different platforms.

## Key Features

- **Clipboard Integration**: Tp-Note can save and edit clipboard content as note
  files, making it easy to capture information quickly.

# Distribution

## Download installer packages and binaries

### Tp-Note Microsoft Windows installer package

* Installer package for Windows:

  [tpnote-latest-x86_64.msi]

  As this early version of the Windows installer is not signed yet, Windows
  will show the error message “Windows protected your PC”. As a work-around,
  when you click on the link “More info”, a ”Run anyway” button will appear
  allowing you to continue the installation process. In general, regardless
  of where a program comes from, I recommend checking every installable
  file with [VirusTotal].

### Tp-Note Debian/Ubuntu installer package

* Package compiled for Debian/Ubuntu:

  [x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debian/tpnote_latest_amd64.deb]

### Various binaries for Windows, MacOS and Linux

* Binaries for Ubuntu-Linux 18.04, Windows, MacOS:

    1. Open: [Releases - getreu/tp-note]

    2. Open the latest release.

    3. Open *assets*.

    4. Download the packed executable for your operating system.

    5. Installation: see below.

* Executable for Windows:

    * [x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/tpnote.exe]

* Linux binary (compiled with Debian):

    * [x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/tpnote]

    * The following "musl" version also works on a headless system.

      [x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/tpnote]

* Binaries for Raspberry Pi (32 bit):

    * [armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/tpnote]

* Binaries for Raspberry Pi (64 bit):

    * [aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/tpnote]



## Tp-Note in official package repositories

### Tp-Note on NetBSD

* An official package is available on NetBSD and other "pkgsrc" supported 
  platforms.

  To install Tp-Note on NetBSD, simply use the native package manager:

  ```sh
  pkgin install tpnote
  ```

### Tp-Note on NixOS

* An official package is available on NixOS:

  ```nix
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.tpnote ]; 
  ```

### Get Tp-Note with the Nix package manager

* First install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download)
  available for Linux, MacOS and Windows (WSL2). 
  Alternatively, for Linux there are also [prebuilt Deb/Pacman/Rpm 
  Nix installers](https://nix-community.github.io/nix-installers/)
  available.
  
  Once you have the Nix package manager installed on your system, 
  try out Tp-Note with:  

  ```nix
  nix-shell -p tpnote
  ```

  or follow installation instructions here:
  [NixOS packages - tpnote](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=tpnote&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=tpnote)
  

## Other resources

* Copy the Unix man-page to `/usr/local/share/man/man1`:

  - [tpnote.1.gz]

* Copy Tp-Note's icon to `/usr/local/share/icons/`:

  - [tpnote.svg]



# Installation

Tp-Note can be installed via a Windows installer package or by placing the
binary directly on your desktop for easy access. It is recommended to integrate
it into your file manager's context menu for convenience.

Depending on the availability of installer packages for your operating
system, the installation process is more or less automated. For Windows
users the fully automated installation package [tpnote-latest-x86_64.msi]
is available. For more information, please consult the [Distribution
section](#distribution) above and the [Installation section] in
_Tp-Note_'s manual. 



## Upgrading

While upgrading _Tp-Note_, new features may cause a change in _Tp-Notes_'s
configuration file structure, e.g.:

```
*** ERROR:
Can not load or parse the (merged) configuration file(s):
---
invalid length 3, expected fewer elements in array in `viewer.served_mime_types`


Note: this error may occur after upgrading Tp-Note due to some incompatible
configuration file changes.

Tp-Note renames and thus disables the last sourced configuration file.

Additional technical details:
*    Command line parameters:
tpnote -b 
*    Sourced configuration files:
/home/joe/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml
```

Mote, the configuration file backup is stored in the same directory as the last
sourced configuration file, e.g. `/home/joe/.config/tpnote/`.
If Tp-Note sources more than one configuration file, consider the possibility
of syntax errors in any of these files (cf. [Customization section] of
Tp-Note's man-page).



# Building

If the above precompiled binaries do not suite you, you can
compile _Tp-Note_ yourself.


1. [Install Rust]

2. Download, compile and install _Tp-Note_:

   **Building on Linux**

   ```sh
   cargo install tpnote
   sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/tpnote /usr/local/bin
   # Download icon
   cd /usr/local/share/icons
   sudo wget https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/assets/tpnote.svg
   ```

   On Linux, Tp-Note displays errors and debug messages as notifications.
   This requires a Linux/BSD based desktop environment that follows the XDG
   specification, e.g. KDE, Gnome, XFCE, LXDC, Mate (and most
   others).[^no-message-box]

   [^no-message-box]: In case an XDG desktop environment is not available, you
      can opt out notifications and message boxes by omitting the `message-box`
      feature by adding 
      `--no-default-features --features lang-detection,read-clipboard,renderer,viewer`
      to `cargo install tpnote`. 
      Now, all error messages are dumped on the console from
      where you started _Tp-Note_ into `stderr`.


   **Recommended Linux console and server version**

   The full-featured version of _Tp-Note_ depends on GUI libraries like Xlib
   which might not be available on a headless system. Either download the Musl
   version [x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/tpnote] or compile _Tp-Note_
   yourself without default features:

   ```sh
   cargo install --no-default-features \
     --features lang-detection,renderer tpnote
   sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/tpnote /usr/local/bin
   ```

   If Tp-Note's binary size if of concern, omit the `lang-detection` feature
   in the `cargo` invocation above. The `lang-detection` feature causes 95% 
   of the final binary size because of its extensive language models.


   **Building on Windows and macOS**

   Build the full-featured version[^win] with:

       cargo install tpnote

   [^win]: When building for Windows or macOS, it does not make sense to exclude
   the `message-box` feature, because - under Windows and macOS - it does not
   rely on the notification library. Instead, it uses direct OS-API calls for
   popping up alert boxes. As these calls have no footprint in binary size or
   speed, always keep the `message-box` feature compiled in.


## Cross compilation

Debian makes it easy to cross-compile for foreign architectures. Here are
some examples:

* Target Musl:

  ```sh
  rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
  sudo apt install musl-tools

  cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
  ```

* Target Raspberry Pi (32 bit):

  ```sh
  rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
  sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf
  
  CARGO_TARGET_ARMV7_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNUEABIHF_LINKER=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc \
  cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --release
  ```

* Target Raspberry Pi (arm64, 64 bit):

  ```sh
  rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
  sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-arm64
  
  CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \
  cargo build  --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
  ```

* Target Windows:
  
  ```sh
  rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu  
  sudo apt install binutils-mingw-w64 mingw-w64
  cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release 
  ```
