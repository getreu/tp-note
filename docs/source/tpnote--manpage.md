# NAME

Tp-Note: Markup enhanced granular note-taking 

Save and edit your clipboard content as a note file.




# SYNOPSIS

    tpnote [-a ] [-b] [-c <FILE>] [-C <FILE>] [-d <LEVEL>] [-e] 
           [-l <LANG>] [-p <NUM>] [-n] [-t] [-u] [-v] [-V] 
           [-x <DIR>|''|'-']
           [<DIR>|<FILE>]




# DESCRIPTION

Tp-Note is a note-taking tool and a template system, that synchronizes the
note's metadata with its filename. Tp-Note analyses its environment and the
clipboard content and stores the result in variables. New notes are
created by filling these variables in predefined and customizable
_Tera_-templates. In case the first positional parameter '`<FILE>`'
points to an existing Tp-Note file, the note's metadata is parsed
and, if necessary, its filename is adjusted. For all other file types,
Tp-Note creates a new note in the same directory annotating the file. If
the positional parameter '`<DIR>`' points to an existing directory (or,
when omitted, the current working directory), a new note is created in
that directory. After creation, Tp-Note launches the systems file editor.
Although the configurable default templates are written for Markdown, Tp-Note
is not tied to any specific markup language. However, Tp-Note comes
with an optional viewer feature, that currently renders only Markdown,
ReStructuredText and HTML input. In addition, there is some limited
support for Asciidoc and WikiText. Finally, the note's rendition is live
updated and displayed in the user's web browser.

After the user finished editing, Tp-Note analyses potential changes in the
notes metadata and renames, if necessary, the file, so that its metadata and
filename are in sync again. Finally, the resulting path is printed to
'`stdout`', log and error messages are dumped to '`stderr`'.

This document is Tp-Note's technical reference. More information
can be found in [Tp-Note's user manual] and at [Tp-Note's project page].

# CREATING NOTE FILES

Tp-Note operates in 5 different modes, depending on its command line arguments
and the clipboard state. Each mode is associated with one content template and
one filename template.



## Create a new note with empty clipboard

In case the clipboard is empty while starting, the new note is created
with the templates: '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' and '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`'. By
default, the new note's title is the parent's directory name. The newly created
file is then opened with an external text editor, allowing it to change the
proposed title and add other content. When the text editor closes, Tp-Note
synchronizes the note's metadata and its filename. This operation is performed
with the '`tmpl.sync_filename`' template.

Use case: the clipboard is empty and '`<path>`' is a directory (or empty):

``` sh
tpnote "./03-Favorite Readings/"
```

or

``` sh
cd "./03-Favorite Readings"
tpnote
```

creates the document:

    ./03-Favorite Readings/20211031-Favorite Readings--Note.md

with the content:

``` yaml
---
title:      Favorite Readings
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2021-10-31
lang:       en-GB
---
```



## Create a new note based on clipboard data

When '`<path>`' is a directory and the clipboard is not empty, the clipboard's
content is stored in the variables '`{{ txt_clipboard.body }}`' and 
'`{{ html_clipboard.body }}`'. The latter contains the HTML rich text version
of the clipboard content. In addition, if the
content contains a hyperlink, the first hyperlink's name can be
accessed with '`{{ txt_clipboard.body | link_text }}`', its URL with
'`{{ txt_clipboard.body | link_dest }}`' and its title with
'`{{ txt_clipboard.body | link_title }}`'. The new note is then created with the
'`tmpl.from_dir_content`' and the '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`'
templates. Finally, the newly created note file is opened again with some
external text editor. When the user closes the text editor, Tp-Note
synchronizes the note's metadata and its filename with the template
'`tmpl.sync_filename`'.

Note: this operation mode also empties the clipboard (configurable feature).


**HTML to Markdown conversion**

In case the clipboard stream contains HTML, the internal filter

```
{{ html_clipboard.body
   | html_to_markup(extension=extension_default, default=txt_clipboard.body) }}
```
 
converts the stream into Markdown before being processed. If the conversion
fails or results in an empty string, the fallback value is
'`{{ txt_clipboard.body }}`' 


**Clipboard simulation**

When no mouse and clipboard is available, the clipboard feature can be
simulated by feeding the clipboard data into `stdin`.

```sh
echo "[The Rust Book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>)" | tpnote
```

Tp-Note behaves here as if the clipboard contained the string:
"`[The Rust Book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>)`".

When you pipe HTML into Tp-Note, make sure that the stream starts with
either '`<!DOCTYPE html`' or '`<html`', e.g.:

```sh
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><h1>Hello World</h1>'| tpnote
```



### The clipboard contains a string

Use case: While launching Tp-Note the clipboard contains the string:
"`Who Moved My Cheese?\n\nChapter 2`" and '`<path>`' is a directory.

``` sh
tpnote "./03-Favorite Readings/"
```

Or:

``` sh
cd "./03-Favorite Readings/"
tpnote
```

This creates the document:

    ./03-Favorite Readings/20211031-Who Moved My Cheese--Note.md

with the content:

```yaml
---
title:      Who Moved My Cheese
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2021-10-31
lang:       en-GB
---

Who Moved My Cheese?

Chapter 2
```

We see from the above example, how the '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' content
template extracts the first line of the clipboards content and inserts it into
the header's '`title:`' field. Then, it copies the entire clipboard content
into the body of the document.  However, if desired or necessary, it is possible
to modify all templates in Tp-Note's configuration file. Note, that not only
the note's content is created with a template, but also its filename: The
'`tmpl.from_dir_filename`' filename template concatenates the current date, the
note's title and subtitle.



### The clipboard contains a heading

Use case: open a web page in your web browser and select some text with it's 
heading. Then copy the content into your (HTML) clipboard:

```html
<h1>Cinderella</h1>
by the Brothers Grimm
```

Launch Tp-Note:

```sh
mkdir 'Fary tales'
tpnote './Fary tales'
```

Tp-Note's templates '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' and '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`'
create the following document:

    ./Fary tales/20250104-Cinderella--Notes.md

```yaml
---
title:        Cinderella
subtitle:     Note
author:       Getreu
date:         2025-01-04
lang:         de-DE
---

# Cinderella

by the Brothers Grimm

```

Tp-Note searches for the first heading tag '`<h1>`', '`<h2>`', '`<h3>`'
etc. in the HTML clipboard and uses the finding as title for the new 
Tp-Note document.

NB: you can achieve the same result by piping the clipboard content into 
Tp-Note:

```sh
mkdir 'Fary tales'
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><h1>Cinderella</h1>by the Brothers Grimm'\
   | tpnote './Fary tales'
```



### The clipboard contains a hyperlink

Use case: '`<path>`' is a directory, the clipboard is not empty and contains
the string: '`I recommend:\n[The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)`'.

```sh
tpnote './doc/Lecture 1'
```

Tp-Note's templates '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' and '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`'
create the following document:

    ./doc/Lecture 1/20211031-The Rust Book--Notes.md

```yaml
---
title:      The Rust Book
subtitle:   URL
author:     Getreu
date:       2021-10-31
lang:       en-GB
---

I recommend:
[The Rust Book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>)
```

When analysing the clipboard's content, Tp-Note searches for hyperlinks in
Markdown, ReStructuredText, Asciidoc and HTML format. When successful, the
content template uses the link text of the first hyperlink found as document
title.


### The clipboard contains a string with a YAML header

Use case: '`<path>`' is a directory, the clipboard is not empty and contains
the string: '`---\ntitle: Todo\nfile_ext: mdtxt\n---\nnothing`'.

```sh
tpnote
```

This creates the note: '`20230915-Todo.mdtxt`' with the following
content:

```yaml
---
title:      Todo
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2023-09-15
lang:       fr-FR

file_ext:   mdtxt
---

nothing
```

Technically, the creation of the new note is performed using the YAML header
variables: '`{{ fm.fm_title }}`', '`{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}`',
'`{{ fm.fm_author }}`', '`{{ fm.fm_date }}`', '`{{ fm.fm_lang }}`',
'`{{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}`' and '`{{ fm.fm_file_ext }}`' which are evaluated with
the '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`' templates.

Note, that the same result can also be achieved without clipboard input by
typing in a terminal:

```sh
echo -e "---\ntitle: Todo\nfile_ext: mdtxt\n---\n\nnothing" | tpnote
```

Furthermore, this operation mode is very handy with pipes in general, as shows
the following example: it downloads some webpage, converts it to Markdown and
copies the result into a Tp-Note file. The procedure preserves the webpage's
title in the note's title:

```sh
curl 'https://blog.getreu.net' \
| pandoc --standalone -f html -t markdown_strict+yaml_metadata_block \
| tpnote
```

creates the note file '`20230919-Jens Getreu's blog--Note.md`' with the
webpage's content converted to Markdown:

```yaml
---
title:      Jens Getreu's blog
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2023-09-15
lang:       en

viewport:   width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1

## Create a new note annotating a non Tp-Note file

When '`<path>`' points to an existing file, whose file extension is other than
'`.md`', a new note is created with a similar filename and a reference to the
original file is copied into the new note's body. If the clipboard contains some
text, it is appended there also. The logic of this is implemented in the
templates: '`tmpl.annotate_file_content`' and
'`tmpl.annotate_file_filename`'. Once the file is created, it is opened with
an external text editor. After editing the file, it will be - if necessary -
renamed to be in sync with the note's metadata.

For example:

``` sh
:> "Classic Shell Scripting.pdf"

tpnote "Classic Shell Scripting.pdf"
```

creates the note:

    Classic Shell Scripting.pdf--Note.md"

with the content:

``` yaml
---
title:      Classic Shell Scripting.pdf
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2023-09-15
lang:       en-US
---

[Classic Shell Scripting.pdf](<Classic Shell Scripting.pdf>)
```

The configuration file variable '`filename.extensions`' list all the file
extensions that Tp-Note recognizes as own file types. Only foreign file types
can be annotated.

Note that the file annotation mode also reads the clipboard's content: when it
is not empty, its data is appended to the new note's body.



## Convert a text file into a Tp-Note file

Consider the content of the following text file
'`Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md`' whose creation date is 13 March 2022:

    A little game designed for primary kids to revise vocabulary in classroom.

To convert the text file into a Tp-Note file type:

```sh
tpnote --add-header --batch "Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md"
```

NB: the '`--add-header`' flag is actually not necessary, as it is enabled by
default through the configuration file variable
'`arg_default.add_header = true`'.

As a result of the above command, Tp-Note converts the filename into:

    20220313-Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md

and prepends a YAML header to the file's content:

```yaml
---
title:      Ascii-Hangman
subtitle:   A game for children
author:     Getreu
date:       2022-03-13
lang:       en-US

orig_name:  Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md
---

A little game designed for primary kids to revise vocabulary in classroom.
```



## Use Tp-Note in shell scripts

* **Use case: download a webpage and store it as Tp-Note file**

  Using the method displayed above you can save time and create a script with:

  ```sh
  sudo nano /usr/local/bin/download
  ```

  Insert the following content:

  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  curl "$1" | tpnote
  ```

  Instead of Tp-Note's internal HTML to Markdown converter, you can 
  alternatively use the external '`pandoc`' converter. This method offers the
  advantage to also convert the HTML page's metadata. Currently, Tp-Note's
  internal converter lacks this feature.

  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  curl "$1" | pandoc --standalone -f html -t markdown_strict+yaml_metadata_block | tpnote
  ```

  Do not forget to make it runnable:

  ```sh
  sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/download
  ```

  To execute the script type:

  ```sh
  download 'https://blog.getreu.net'
  ```




# NOTE FILE MANIPULATION

## Editing notes

Unless invoked with '`--batch`' or '`--view`', Tp-Note launches an external
text editor after creating a new note. This also happens when '`<path>`' points
to an existing '`.md`'-file.

For example: open and edit an existing note file:

``` bash
cd "./03-Favorite Readings"
tpnote 20211031-Favorite Readings--Note.md
```



## Viewing notes

Once Tp-Note has launched the user's file editor, it opens the note file,
renders its content to HTML, launches the user's web browser and connects it to
Tp-Note's internal web server. Then, Tp-Note watches the note file and
re-renders the viewed HTML when the content changes. The note's file extension
determines which internal renderer is activated. 

Tp-Note's note built-in viewer comprises three markup language renders:

* '`Markdown`'_ (file extension `.md`)\
  This renderer is CommonMark compatible and feature complete. It understands,
  heading attributes, inline images, tables, task lists, footnotes, 
  strike-through and LaTeX formula:

  ````latex
  ```math
  x^n + y^n = z^n
  ```
  ````

  Or:

  ````
  $$
  x^n + y^n = z^n
  $$
  ````

  Inline formulas are enclosed between Dollar characters, 
  e.g. '``` $\alpha$ ```' becomes '` `$\alpha$` `'.

  Source code is highlighted when you annotate the programming
  language (see also '`tmpl_html.viewer_highlighting_theme`' and
  '`tmpl_html.exporter_highlighting_theme`'):

  ````md
  ```rust
  pub fn main(){
    let w = "world!";
    println!("Hallo {:?}", w);
  }
  ```
  ````

  Heading attributes:

  ```md
  # text { #id .class1 .class2 myattr other_attr=myvalue }
  ```

  is interpreted as a level 1 heading with the content text, ID '`id`', classes
  '`class1`' and '`class2`' and custom attributes '`myattr`' (without value)
  and '`other_attr`' with value '`myvalue`'. Note that ID, classes, and custom
  attributes should be space-separated.

* '`ReStructuredText`' (file extension `.rst`)\
  This renderer is experimental and covers only basic markup.

* '`PlainText`' (link only renderer, file extension `.txtnote`)\
  The purpose of this renderer is to make hyperlinks written in 
  Markdown, ReStructuredText, Asciidoc, HTML, Wikitext syntax clickable.
  Only hyperlinks are rendered, all other text is shown verbatim.

Tp-Note's webserver streams large media files without loading them into
memory. Just refer to the media file as local link: 
'`[my video](<dir/my video.mp4>)`'. Make sure, that the file extension of the
video file is registered with '`viewer.served_mime_types`'.




## Automatic filename synchronization before and after editing

Before launching the text editor and after closing it, Tp-Note synchronizes
the filename with the note's metadata. When the user changes the metadata of a
note, Tp-Note will replicate that change in the note's filename. As a result,
*all your note's filenames always correspond to their metadata*, which helps
to retrieve your notes in large data pools.

For example:

```sh
tpnote "20200306-Favorite Readings--Note.md"
```

The way how Tp-Note synchronizes the note's metadata and filename is defined
in the template '`tmpl.sync_filename`'.

Once Tp-Note opens the file in your text editor, let's assume you decide to 
change the title in the note's YAML metadata section from 
'`title: Favorite Readings`' to '`title: Introduction to bookkeeping`'.
After closing the text editor, Tp-Note updates the filename automatically:

    20200306-Introduction to bookkeeping--Note.md

Note: the sort tag '`20200306`' has not changed. The filename synchronization
mechanism by default never does. (See below for more details about filename
synchronization).



## Printing note files

Tp-Note renders note files to HTML. The latter is either shown in the browser
or can be exported with '`--export`'.  When exporting to HTML, hyperlinks
are passed through an internal link rewriting engine that can be parametrized
with '`--export-link-rewriting`'. The easiest way to print the resulting
HTML, is to pipe it through an HTML to PDF converter, e.g. _Weasyprint_ or
_Wkhtmktopdf_.

```sh
tpnote --export=- mynote.md | weasyprint - mynote.md.pdf
```

_Weasyprint_ supports the  [CSS Paged Media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/)
standard allowing to include page layout directives into HTML. You can
change the default page layout by modifying the HTML template with the
'`tmpl_html.exporter_doc_css`' configuration file variable.



## Use Tp-Note in shell scripts

* **Use case: synchronize recursively filenames and metadata**

  The following synchronizes bidirectionally all filenames with the note's YAML
  header data.

  ```sh
  TPNOTE_USER="John" find . -type f -name '*.md' -exec tpnote -a -b {} > /dev/null \;
  ```

  The direction of the synchronization depends on whether the '`.md`' file has
  a valid YAML header or not:

  * A YAML header is present and valid: the header fields might update
    the filename (see template '`tmpl.sync_filename`'). A possible _sort-tag_
    at the beginning of the filename remains untouched.

  * No YAML header: a new header is prepended (see template
    '`from_text_file_content`') and the filename might change slightly
    (see template '`from_text_file_filename`'). A possible _sort-tag_
    at the beginning of the filename remains untouched. If the filename
    does not start with a sort tag, the file's creation date is prepended.




# OPTIONS

**-a**, **\--add-header**

>   Prepends a YAML header in case the text file does not have one.
    The default template, deduces the '`title:`' and '`subtitle:`'
    header field from the filename. It's sort-tag and file extension
    remain untouched. In case the filename is lacking a _sort-tag_,
    the file creation date in numerical format is prepended.
    As this option is activated by default, it has no effect unless
    you set '`arg_default.add_header = false`' in the configuration
    file.


**-b**, **\--batch**

>   Do not launch the external text editor or viewer. All other operations
    are available and are executed in the same way. In batch mode, error
    messages are dumped on the console only and no alert windows pop up.

>   Tp-Note ignores the clipboard when run in batch mode with '`--batch`'.
    Instead, if available, it reads the `stdin` stream as if the data came
    from the clipboard.

**-c** *FILE*, **\--config**=*FILE*

>   Loads an additional configuration from the TOML formatted *FILE* 
    and merges it into the default configuration.

**-C** *FILE*, **\--config-defaults**=*FILE*

>   Dumps the internal default configuration in TOML format into *FILE* or
    stdout if *FILE* equals to '`-`', e.g. '`tpnote -C - | less`'.

**-d** *LEVEL*, **\--debug**=*LEVEL*

>   Prints additional log messages.  The debug level *LEVEL* must be one out of
    '`trace`', '`debug`', '`info`', '`warn`', '`error`' (default) or '`off`'.
    The level '`trace`' reports the most detailed information, while '`error`'
    informs you only about failures.  A '`warn`' level message means, that not
    all functionality might be available or work as expected.

>   Use '`-b -d trace`' for debugging templates and '`-V -b -d trace`' for
    debugging configuration files.  If the HTTP server (viewer) does not work
    as expected: '`-n -d debug`'. If your text editor does not open as expected:
    '`-n -d info --edit`'. Or, to observe the launch of the web browser: '`-n
    -d info --view`'. The option '`-d trace`' shows all available template
    variables, the templates used and the rendered result of the substitution.
    This is particularly useful for debugging new templates. The option '`-d
    off`' silences all error message reporting and also suppresses the error
    pop-up windows.

>   Note, under Linux, when `-d trace` is given, no pop-up messages appear.
    Instead, the logs are dumped to the console from where you started Tp-Note.

>   All error messages are dumped in the error stream `stderr` and appear
    on the console from where Tp-Note was launched:

        tpnote.exe --debug info my_note.md

>   Under Windows the output must be redirected into a file to see it:

        tpnote.exe --debug info my_note.md >debug.md 2>&1

>   Alternatively, you can redirect all log file entries into popup alert
    windows.

        tpnote.exe --popup --debug info my_note.md

>   The same can be achieved by setting following configuration file
    variables (especially useful with Windows):

        [arg_default]
        debug = 'info'
        popup = true

>   The value for '`arg_default.debug`' must be one out of '`trace`',
    '`debug`', '`info`', '`warn`', '`error`' (default) and '`off`'. They have
    the same meaning as the corresponding command line options.

**-e**, **\--edit**

>   Edit only mode: opens the external text editor, but not the file
    viewer. This disables Tp-Note's internal file watcher and web server,
    unless '`-v`' is given. Alternatively you can set the environment
    variable '`TPNOTE_BROWSER=""`' to the empty string. Another way to
    permanently disable the web server is to set the configuration variable
    '`arg_default.edit=true`'.  When '`--edit --view`' appear together, both
    the editor and the viewer will open and the `arg_default.edit` variable
    is ignored.

**-l** *LANGUAGE_TAG*, **\--force-lang**=*LANGUAGE_TAG*

>   Disables the automatic language detection while creating a new note file
    and use *LANGUAGE_TAG* instead. *LANGUAGE_TAG* is formatted as IETF BCP
    47 language tag, e.g. '`en-US`'. If *LANGUAGE_TAG* equals '``', the
    environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG`' determines the language instead; or, if
    the latter is not defined, the user's default language, as reported from the
    operating system's locale setting, is decisive.

**-p** *PORT*, **\--port**=*PORT*

>   Sets the server port that the web browser connects to, to the specified
    value *PORT*.
    If not given, a random available port is chosen automatically.

**-n**, **\--no-filename-sync**

>   Whenever Tp-Note opens a note file, it synchronizes its YAML-metadata with
    its filename. '`--no-filename-sync`' disables this synchronization.  In
    addition, in scripts this flag can be especially useful for validating
    the syntax of '`.md`'-files. See section EXIT STATUS for more details. The
    section METADATA FILENAME SYNCHRONIZATION shows alternative ways to disable
    synchronization.

**-s** *PORT*, **\--scheme**=*SCHEME_NAME*

>   Sets the filename scheme for creating a new note file. This overwrites the
    '`arg_default.scheme`' value in the configuration file. Under
    '`[[scheme]]`' follows the definition of the schemes. The default
    configuration ships two schemes with the SCHEME_NAMES '`default`' and 
    '`zettel`' (for Zettelkasten).

**-t**, **\--tty**

>   Tp-Note tries different heuristics to detect whether a graphic environment
    is available or not. For example, under Linux, the '`DISPLAY`' environment
    variable is evaluated. The '`--tty`' flag disables the automatic detection
    and sets Tp-Note into "console only" mode: now only the non GUI editor
    (see configuration variable: '`app_args.editor_console`') and no viewer
    is launched.

**-u**, **\--popup**

>   Redirects log file entries into popup alert windows. Must be used together
    with the **\--debug** option to have an effect. Note, that debug level
    '`error`' conditions will always trigger popup messages, regardless of
    **\--popup** and **\--debug** (unless '`--debug off`'). Popup alert windows
    are queued and will never interrupt Tp-Note. To better associate a
    particular action with its log events, read through all upcoming popup alert
    windows until they fail to appear. As this option is activated by default,
    it has no effect unless you set '`arg_default.popup = false`' in the
    configuration file.

**-v**, **\--view**

>   View only mode: do not open the external text editor. This flag instructs
    Tp-Note to start an internal file watcher and web server and connect
    the system's default web browser to view the note file and to observe live
    file modifications. The configuration setting '`arg_default.edit=true`'
    or the environment variable '`TPNOTE_EDITOR=""`' disables the viewer.
    However, with '`--view`' given at the command line, the viewer appears,
    regardless of the value of '`arg_default.edit`'.

>   NB: By default, Tp-Note tries to synchronize every file it opens. To 
    prevent the viewed filename from changing, '`--view`' can be used together
    with '`--no-filename-sync`'.

**-V**, **\--version**

>   Print Tp-Note's version, its built-in features and the path to the
    sourced configuration file. The output is YAML formatted for further
    automatic processing. In addition, use '`-V -b -d trace`' for 
    configuration file debugging.

**-x** *DIRECTORY*, **\--export**=*DIRECTORY*

>   Prints the note as HTML rendition into _DIRECTORY_. '`-x -`' prints to
    _stdout_. If _DIRECTORY_ is a relative path, _DIRECTORY_ is appended to the
    document directory. For example, e.g. '`--export=.`' or '`-x ./`', prints the
    HTML rendition in the directory where the note file resides. This option
    prevents the launch of the external text editor and viewer and can
    be combined with '`--batch`' to avoid popup error alert windows.

**\--export-link-rewriting**=*MODE*

>   Chooses how local links in the exported HTML file are written out: '`off`',
    '`short`' or '`long`' (default). No link rewriting occurs, for the *MODE*
    '`off`'. The *MODE* '`short`' rewrites all local relative links to absolute
    links, whose base is the first parent directory containing the marker
    file '`tpnote.toml`'. NB, the directory of the marker file defines the
    base for all absolute local links in your Tp-Note file! The mode '`long`'
    rewrites *all* local links to absolute links whose base is the system's root
    directory '`/`'. For relative local links this is performed by prepending
    the path to the note file. Absolute local links get the path to the marker
    file '`tpnote.toml`' prepended. In case you do not place a '`tpnote.toml`'
    file in a parent directory, the base for absolute local links in your note
    file is interpreted as '`/`'.
    
>   The right *MODE* choice depends on how you view the resulting HTML:
    if you publish on a web server, then '`short`' might be a good choice. Do 
    not forget to place a marker file '`tpnote.toml`' somewhere in the
    document's path. If you view the HTML file directly in your web browser,
    better choose '`long`'. In this case, the present of a marker file will not
    affect the output.
    NB: You can also set this option via Tp-Note's configuration file
    with the key '`arg_default.export_link_rewriting`'. 




# THE NOTE'S DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

Tp-Note considers a text file to be a valid note file, if its:

* file extension is listed in one of the configuration file variable
  '`filename.extensions`'; if its

* content has a valid YAML header and

* the YAML header contains a key whose name is defined in the configuration
  file variable '`tmpl.compulsory_header_field`' (default '`title`').

A Tp-Note note file is always UTF-8 encoded. As newline, either the Unix
standard '`\n`' or the Windows standard '`\r\n`' is accepted. Tp-Note writes
out newlines according the operating system it runs on.



## The document's header and body

Tp-Note is designed to be compatible with '`Pandoc`'s and '`RMarkdown`s
document structure as shown in the figure below. In this documentation
the terms "YAML header", "header" and "front matter" are used as
synonyms to designate to document's metadata block at the beginning
of the text file:

```
---
<YAML-front-matter>
---

<document-body>
```

The YAML front-matter starts at the beginning of the document with '`---`'
and ends with '`...`' or '`---`'. Note that according to the YAML standard,
string literals are always encoded as JSON strings. By convention, a valid
Tp-Note file has at least one YAML field named '`title:`' (the name of this
compulsory field is defined by the '`tmpl.compulsory_header_field`'
variable in the configuration file and can be changed there).

Note that prepended text, placed before the YAML front-matter, is ignored. There
are however certain restrictions: If present, the skipped text should not be too
long (cf. constant '`BEFORE_HEADER_MAX_IGNORED_CHARS`' in the source code of
Tp-Note) and it must be followed by at least one blank line:

```
Prepended text is ignored.

---
<YAML-front-matter>
---

<document-body>
```

There is no restriction about the markup language being used in the note's text
body. However, the default templates assume Markdown and the file extension
'`.md`'. Both can be changed easily by adapting Tp-Note's configuration file.
Besides the requirements concerning its header, a valid Tp-Note file must have
a filename extension that is listed in the configuration file variable:
'`filename.extensions`'. The latter also determines which internal markup
language render is called for Tp-Note's internal viewer.



## Links to resources and other documents


### Link types

The document's body often contains (inline) links to resources e.g. images and
links to other documents. This section describes how the automatic path
rewriting of local links works.

In general, the link syntax depends on the markup language used in the Tp-Note
file. The following examples illustrate the different link types Tp-Note 
understands:

| Link type                  | Example in Markdown notation                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Absolute URL               | '`[blog](<https://blog.getreu.net>)`'        |
| Relative URL (=local link) | '`![Alt text](<images/my logo.png>)`'        |
| Absolute local link        | '`![Alt text](</images/my logo.png>)`'       |
| Relative local link        | '`![Alt text](<images/my logo.png>)`'        |
| Relative local link        | '`[my doc](<../../notes/31-my doc.md>)`'     |
| Relative local autolink    | '`<tpnote:../../notes/31-my%20doc.md>`'      |
| Shorthand link             | '`[my doc](<../../notes/31>)`'               |
| Shorthand autolink         | '`<tpnote:../../notes/31>`'                  |
| Formatted shorthand link   | '`<tpnote:../../notes/31?-->)`'              |

Remarks:
 
* The base for absolute local links is the first parent directory containing
  the marker file '`tpnote.toml`'. If absent, absolute local links refer
  to the root directory '`/`'.
* *Shorthand link*: Instead of writing out the full link destination, e.g. 
  '`[my doc](<./docs/20230508-my note.md>)`', you can shorten the link to
  '`[my doc](<docs/20230508>)`' indicating only the destination's sort-tag.
  Alternatively, the same shorthand link can be expressed as autolink as well:
  '`<http:docs/20230508>`'. NB, if more than one document with the same
  sort-tag exist in a directory, the viewer only displays the first in
  alphabetical order. To set up a different order, you can extend the 
  sort-tag until it becomes unique, e.g. by renaming the destination document in
  the above example to '`./ docs/20230508a-my note.md`'. This way you obtain the
  unique sort-tag '`20230508a`'.

Although Tp-Note's built in viewer follows absolute and relative local links,
usually the latter are preferred. They make moving documents easier, as relative
links do not break when the source and the destination documents are moved
together.

As mentioned above, the shortest way to refer to other Tp-Note documents, is
indicating their sort-tag only, e.g. '`<tpnote:dir/123>`' and 
'`[my file](<tpnote:dir/123>)`'. If the other document is located in the same
directory, the links are even shorter: '`<tpnote:123>`' and 
'`[my file](<tpnote:123>)`'. 


### Local links in HTML export

Tp-Note's exporter function '`--export`' converts a given Tp-Note file into
HTML and adds '`.html`' to the output filename. Links in the documents content
to other Tp-Note files are hereby rewritten by appending '`.html`' to their
URLs. This way you can convert groups of documents to HTML and later jump from
document to document in your web browser. The option '`--export-link-rewriting`'
allows you to fine-tune how local links are written out. Valid values are:
'`off`', '`short`' and '`long`'.

In order to achieve this, the user must respect the following convention
concerning absolute paths in local links in Tp-Note documents: When a document
contains a local link with an absolute path, the base of this path is
considered to be the directory where the marker file '`tpnote.toml`' resides
(or '`/`' in non exists). The option '`--export-link- rewriting`' decides how
local links in the Tp-Note document are converted when the HTML is generated.
If its value is '`short`', then local links with relative paths are converted to
absolute paths. The base of the resulting path is where the '`tpnote.toml`' file
resides (or `/` if none exists).  Consider the following example 
'`--export-link-rewriting=short`':

* The Tp-Note file '`/my/docs/car/bill.md`' contains
* an absolute local link: '`/car/scan.jpg`',
* and another relative local link: '`./photo.jpg`'.
* The document root marker is: '`/my/docs/tpnote.toml`'.

The images in the resulting HTML will appear as

* '`/car/scan.jpg`'.
* '`/car/photo.jpg`'.

For '`--export-link-rewriting=long`', in addition to the above, all absolute
paths in local links are prepended with the marker file's directory. Consider
the following example:

* The Tp-Note file '`/my/docs/car/bill.md`' contains
* an absolute local link: '`/car/scan.jpg`',
* and another relative local link: '`./photo.jpg`'.
* The document root marker is: '`/my/docs/tpnote.toml`'.

The images in the resulting HTML will appear as

* '`/my/docs/car/scan.jpg`'.
* '`/my/docs/car/photo.jpg`'.

Summary: The right '`--export-link-rewriting`' choice depends on how you view
the resulting HTML: if you publish on a web server, then '`short`' might be
a good choice (do not forget to place a marker file '`tpnote.toml`' somewhere 
in the document's path). If you view the HTML file directly in your web 
browser, better choose '`long`'.


### Local links with format strings

So far, we have seen how Tp-Note's viewer and HTML exporter converts the
_destination_ of local links '`[text](destination)`'.
Concerning the local link's _text_ property, the situation is simpler
as the _text_ property never changes during the above discussed
rewriting process. However, it is possible to overwrite the displayed text
property by appending a _format string_ to the destination: 
'`[formatted destination](destination?format string)`'. 

All local links in the following tables have the same link destination
'`dir/01ac-Tulips--red, yellow.md`'. The examples differ only in the way the
link is displayed in the browser.


| Local link                                          | What you see        |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| '`[matters](<dir/01ac-Tulips--red, yellow.md>)`'    | matters             |
| '`[matters](<dir/01ac>)`'                           | matters             |


| Formatted local link                                 | What you see        |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac-Tulips--red, yellow.md?>)`'   | Tulips--red, yellow |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac?>)`'                          | Tulips--red, yellow |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac?,>)`'                         | Tulips--red         |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac?-->)`'                        | Tulips              |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac?--:,>)`'                      | red                 |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac?#>)`'                         | 01ac                |
| '`[whatever](<dir/01ac??>)`'                         | 01ac-Tulips--red, yellow.md |

Observations: 

1. The format operator '`?`' (not followed by a '`#`') strips the path,
   the sort-tag, the copy-counter and the filename extension. In other words, it
   keeps only the file stem.
2. The string following the question mark is the _to pattern_: '`?<to>`'. It 
   marks the exclusive end of the matching. 
3. Consider the pattern '`?<from>:<to>`': The string before the colon is the 
   _from pattern_, the string after the colon is the _to pattern_.
   Patterns are always searched from the start of the string, e.g. in Latin
   scripts from the left to the right.
4. The format operator '`?#`' prints the sort-tag. 
5. The format operator '`??`' prints the whole filename.
6. All format operators can be optionally followed by a search pattern.

# METADATA FILENAME SYNCHRONIZATION

Consider the following Tp-Note filename generated with the _default_ 
filename scheme (cf section "Filename synchronization schemes" for other
schemes):

    20151208-Make this world a better place--Suggestions.md

The filename has 4 parts:

    {{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}-{{ fm.fm_title }}--{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}.{{ fm.fm_file_ext }}

The '`-`' between '`{{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}`' and '`{{ fm.fm_title }}`' is hereafter
referred to as _sort-tag separator_ (cf. '`filename.sort_tag.separator`').

A so-called _sort tag_ is an alphanumerical prefix at the beginning of the
filename. It is used to order files and notes in the file system. Besides
numerical digits and lowercase letters, a _sort tag_ may contain any 
combination of '`_`', '`-`', '`=`' and '`.`' (cf. 
'`filename.sort_tag.extra_chars`'). If a sort-tag contains lowercase letters, 
only 2 in a row are allowed (cf. 
'`filename.sort_tag.letters_in_succession_max `'). For example:

* *Chronological sort tag*

        20140211-Reminder.doc
        20151208-Manual.pdf
        2015-12-08-Manual.pdf

  NB: All chronological sort-tags must have at least one counter with 4 digits
  or more, e.g. '`2015`'. The character '`-`' between the counters is optional.

  Tip: Always include the year with 4 digits in chronological sort-tags.
  
* *Sequence number sort tag*

        02-Invoices/
        08-Tax documents/
        09_2_144-Manual.pdf
        09.9.1-Notes.md

  NB: None of the counters exceeds 3 digits (cf. 
  '`filename.sort_tag.sequential.digits_in_succession_max`') which is the
  criterium to recognize a sequence number sort-tag. The largest counter in 
  these examples is '`144`', so all sort_tags are sequence numbers.
  

* *Alphanumerical sequence number sort tag*

        02-Invoices/
        08-Tax documents/
        09b144-Manual.pdf
        09i1-Notes.md

  NB: the example is equivalent to the previous one. The only difference is,
  that the separators are expressed through the alternation of digits and 
  letters. 

**Summary:**

1. A _sort-tag_ is composed of a number of counters, which can be numerical,
   e.g. '`123.28`' or combined numerical/letter based, e.g. '`123ab`'.

2. A counter is set of digits (base 10) '`123`' or a set of lowercase
   letters (base 26) '`ab`'.

3. A letter based counter can be maximal 2 letters wide. Its maximum is
   '`zz`' (cf. '`filename.sort_tag.letters_in_succession_max`').

4. A _sequential sort-tag_ is a sort-tag that whose counters are at most 3
   digits wide (cf. '`sort_tag.sequential.digits_in_succession_max`').

5. The filter '`incr_sort_tag`' increments only sequential sort-tags.

6. In order not to confuse sequential and chronological sort-tags, it is
   recommended to always write out the year in chronological sort-tags with 4
   digits, e.g. ''`2013-08-10`' or '`20130810`'.
 


Before Tp-Note creates a new note file, it searches the current directory for
the latest existing Tp-Note file. If that file starts with a sequence number
sort-tag, Tp-Note increments that number and uses the result as sort-tag for the
new note file.  Otherwise, the new note gets a chronological sort tag of today.

A note's filename is said to be in sync with its metadata, when the following
holds (slightly simplified, see '`tmpl.sync_filename`'):

> filename on disk without *sort tag* == '`{{ fm.fm_title }}--{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}.md`'

^[The variables '`{{ fm.fm_title }}`' and '`{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}`' reflect the values
in the note's front matter.]

For example, consider the following document with the filename:

    20211031-My file.md

and the content:

``` yaml
---
title:      1. The Beginning
subtitle:   Note
author:     Getreu
date:       2021-10-31
lang:       en-GB

remainder:  false
---
```

As '`My file.md`' is not equal to '`1. The Beginning--Note.md`',
Tp-Note will rename the file to '`20211031-1. The Beginning--Note.md`'.
If the filename had been '`05_02-My file.md`', it would rename it to
'`05_02-1. The Beginning--Note.md`'.

Note: When the YAML front-matter does not contain the optional '`sort_tag`'
variable, Tp-Note will never change a sort tag. Nevertheless, it might
change the rest of the filename!

The reason why by default Tp-Note does not change sort tags is, that they
define their order in the file listing. In general this order is independent of
the notes content. The simplest way to organize the sort tags of your files is
by renaming them directly in your file system. Nevertheless, in some cases you
might want to have full control over the whole filename through the note's YAML
front-matter. For example, if — for some reason — you have changed the
document's date in the front-matter and you want to change the chronological
sort tag in one go. In order to overwrite the note's sort tag on disk, you can
add a '`sort_tag`' string-variable to its front-matter:

``` yaml
---
title:      1. The Beginning
date:       2021-10-31

sort_tag:   '20211101'
---
```

Note, the above sort-tag value - here a number - must be enclosed with
quotes in order label it as string type. When Tp-Note synchronizes the
note's metadata with its filename, it will also change the sort tag from
'`20211031`' to '`20211101`'. The resulting filename becomes 
'`20211101-1. The Beginning--Note.md`'.

The '`sort_tag`' variable also becomes handy, when you want to create one single
note without any sort tag:

``` yaml
---
title:      1. The Beginning

sort_tag:   ''
---
```

In the same way, how it is possible to pin the sort tag of the note from within
the note's metadata, you can also change the file extension by adding the
optional '`file_ext`' variable into the note's front-matter:

``` yaml
---
title:      1. The Beginning

file_ext:   rst
---
```

This will change the file extension from '`.md`' to '`.rst`'. The resulting
filename becomes '`20211101-1. The Beginning--Note.rst`'.

Important: '`rst`' must be one of the registered file extensions
listed in the '`filename.extensions`' variable in Tp-Note's configuration
file. If needed you can add more extensions there. If the new filename extension
is not listed in one of these variables, Tp-Note will not be able to
recognize the note file as such and will not open it in the external text editor
and viewer.

Note: When a '`sort_tag`' variable is defined in the note's YAML header, you
should not change the sort tag string in the note's file name manually by
renaming the file, as your change will be overwritten next time you open the
note with Tp-Note.  However, you can switch back to Tp-Note's default
behaviour any time by deleting the '`sort_tag`' line in the note's metadata.
The same applies to the '`file_ext`' variable.

The metadata filename synchronization feature can be disabled permanently
by setting the configuration file variable
'`arg_default.no_filename_sync = true`'. To disable this feature for one time
only, invoke Tp-Note with '`--no-filename-sync`'. To exclude a particular note
from filename synchronization, add the YAML header field 
'`filename_sync: false`'.

``` yaml
---
title:         1. The Beginning   

filename_sync: false
---
```

Note, that in the above described examples, the information flow always goes
from the YAML note header towards the note's filename. However, when Tp-Note
opens a text file without a YAML header, a new header is added automatically.
In this case the information flow goes from the filename towards the header,
namely in the opposite direction. Once the new header is prepended to the text
file, a regular filename synchronization - as described above - is triggered and
executed as described above.



## Filename synchronization schemes

Technically, the rules how the note's header relates to its filename are
encoded in customizable so-called filename templates (cf. section _Templates_).
These templates exist in two different variants referred to as _default scheme_
and _zettel scheme_:

1. The `'default'` scheme:

   For example:

   ``` yaml
   ---
   title:      1. The Beginning
   subtitle:   Note
   ---

   Once upon a time...
   ```

   The filename synchronization template from the _default scheme_ set looks
   like (simplified):

       {{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}-{{ fm.fm_title }}--{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}.{{ fm.fm_file_ext }}

   It generates from the above example the filename: 
   
       20211031-1. The Beginning--Note.md 


2. The '`zettel`' scheme:

   Although the default scheme covers most of the daily note-taking,
   Luhmann's _Zettelkasten_ knowledge management system requires slightly
   different templates, hence the name _zettel scheme_.

   The following example illustrates the header fields of a typical '`zettel`'
   scheme note file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title:    Lemon
   keywords:
             - fruit
             - round
             - sour taste
   scheme:   zettel
   sort_tag: 2b3
   ---
   
   The [lemon] belongs to the Rutaceae family.
   [lemon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon
   ```

   The filename synchronization template from the _zettel scheme_ set looks 
   like (simplified):
    
       {{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}--{{ fm.fm_title }}__{{ fm.fm_keywords }}.{{ fm.fm_file_ext }}

   It generates the following filename:

       2b3--Lemon__fruit_round_sour taste.md


   

# CUSTOMIZATION

Tp-Note is shipped with a default internal configuration that can be customized
by merging a series of configuration files from various locations into the 
default values. This happens in the following order:

1. Unix and macOS only: '`/etc/tpnote/tpnote.toml`'
2. The file the environment variable '`TPNOTE_CONFIG`' points to.
3. The user's configuration file:
   - Unix: '`~/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml`'
   - Windows: '`C:\Users\<LOGIN>\AppData\Roaming\tpnote\config\tpnote.toml>`'
   - macOS: '`/Users/<LOGIN>/Library/Application Support/tpnote`'
4. At startup all parent directories of the note file path '`<PATH>`' are
   searched for a marker file named '`tpnote.toml`'. If found, the document root
   moves from '`/`' to the found location. If present and its content is not
   empty, Tp-Note interprets the file's content as configuration file.
5. The file indicated by the command line parameter '`--config <FIlE>`'. 

When Tp-Note starts, it first merges all available configuration files into
the default configuration. Then the resulting syntax is checked.  If not
correct, the last sourced configuration file is renamed (thus disabled) and
Tp-Note starts with its internal default configuration. For debugging, you can
print out the merged result with '`-V -b -d trace`'.

```sh
tpnote -V -b -d trace  |less
```

To write a custom configuration file, generate a template with '`-C`':

```sh
tpnote -C ~/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml
```

The template shows all variables with their defaults values. When you change
a value, do not forget to uncomment the modified line to activate your change.
Also make sure to keep the '`version`' variable at the beginning of the file
commented out. As any Tp-Note upgrade might include a breaking change in the
configuration file structure, try to keep your custom configuration small.

Some filename and template related variables are grouped into a '`scheme`'.
The shipped configuration file lists two schemes: '`default`' and '`zettel`'.
The scheme used when creating a new note, is selected by the
commend line option '`--scheme`', the environment variable '`TPNOTE_SCHEME`'
or the configuration variable '`arg_default.scheme`'. The scheme selected
when synchronizing a Tp-Note header with its filename depends on the value
of the header variable '`scheme:`' which defaults to '`default`' (cf.
'`scheme_sync_default`').

Note, that the merging algorithm merges all values, except arrays. These are
usually replaced by the subsequent configuration file. There is one exception
though: top level arrays are also merged. An example to this is the top
level array '`[[scheme]]`'. In the following example we overwrite the variable
'`extension_default`' in the scheme '`default`'. All other variables remain
untouched.

```toml
[[scheme]]
name="default"
[scheme.filename]
extension_default = "txt"
```

When your changes apply to all schemes, the best way is to modify the base
scheme ('`base_scheme`') instead, since all schemes inherit their (default)
values from the base scheme:

```toml
[base_scheme.filename]
extension_default = "txt"
```

Make sure, that your change is not explicitly overwritten in a scheme
definition, as the latter takes precedence.

To add a custom scheme you must explicitly overwrite all variables that differ
from the base scheme `base_scheme`:

```toml
[[scheme]]
name="my-custom-scheme"
[scheme.filename]
# Insert all variables here, that differ from `base_scheme`.
[scheme.tmpl]
# Insert all variables here, that differ from `base_scheme`.
```

The following example illustrates how non-top-level arrays are overwritten
by the subsequent configuration file. The default configuration lists
about 20 MIME types. After merging the following example, the configuration
lists only the two MIME types '`jpeg`' and '`jpg`' in '`served_mime_types`'.

```toml
[viewer]
served_mime_types = [
    ["jpeg", "image/jpeg"],
    ["jpg", "image/jpeg"],
]
```



## Register your own text editor

There are two ways to modify the default file editor, Tp-Note launches
when it starts: either you can modify the configuration file variables
'`app_args.*.editor`' and '`app_args.*.editor_console`', or alternatively,
you can set the '`TPNOTE_EDITOR`' environment variable (cf. examples in the
chapter _ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_ below).

The configuration file variables '`app_args.unix.editor`' and
'`app_args.unix.editor_console`' define lists of external text editors to be
launched for editing. The lists contain by default well-known text editor names
and their command line arguments for Unix like operating
systems. For other systems consult: '`app_args.windows.editor`',
'`app_args.windows.editor_console`', '`app_args.macos.editor`' and
'`app_args.macos.editor_console`'. Tp-Note tries to launch every text editor
in '`app_args.*.editor`' from the beginning of the list until it finds an
installed text editor. When Tp-Note is started on a Linux console, the list
'`app_args.*.editor_console`' is used instead. Here you can register text
editors that do not require a graphical environment, e.g. '`vim`' or '`nano`'.
In order to use your own text editor, just place it at the top of the list. To
debug your changes invoke Tp-Note with '`tpnote --debug debug --popup --edit`'.

The following example showcases the configuration for the _Kate_
file editor.  The entry '`kate`' launches the binary, while the command
line parameter '`--block`' guarantees, that the launched process blocks
until the user closes the editor. Tp-Note detects the end of the process,
checks if the title of the note files has changed in its YAML header
and renames the note file if necessary.

```toml
[app_args]
unix.editor = [
  [
    "kate",
    "--block"
  ]
]
```

The equivalent configuration with environment variable:

```sh
TPNOTE_EDITOR="kate --block" tpnote
```

All items in the above list are subject to limited template expansion allowing
to insert the value of environment variables. Consider the following example:

```toml
[app_args]
windows.editor = [
    [
        "{{get_env(name=\"LOCALAPPDATA\")}}\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe",
        "-n",
        "-w",
    ]
]
```

When the configuration file is loaded, the above expression
'`{{ get_env(name="LOCALAPPDATA") }}`' expands under Windows for a user with
the username '`Joe`' to '`C:\User\Joe\AppData\Local`' resulting in:

```toml
[app_args]
windows.editor = [
    [
    "C:\\User\\Joe\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe",
    "--new-window", "--wait",
    ]
]
```

In general, when you configure Tp-Note to work with your text editor, make sure,
that your text editor does not fork! You can check this by launching the text
editor from the command line: if the command prompt returns immediately, then
the file editor forks the process. On the other hand everything is OK, when the
command prompt only reappears at the moment the text editor is closed. Many text
editors provide an option to restrain from forking: for example the _Visual
Studio Code_ file editor can be launched with the '`--wait`' option, _Vim_ with
'`--nofork`' or _Kate_ with '`--block`'.


However, Tp-Note also works with forking text editors. Although this should be
avoided, there is a possible workaround. Observe the following example:

```sh
$ TPNOTE_EDITOR="kate" tpnote
/home/getreu/20230714-getreu--Note.md
$ 
```

In the above example Tp-Note launches the '`kate`' editor in a forking manner
as the command line flag '`--block`' is missing. Internally the editor process
launching returns immediately, leaving Tp-Note without any means to detect when
exactly the user closes the editor. Hence, Tp-Note is not able to check if the
user has changed the note's header and no filename synchronization can occur
afterwards.

As a workaround, you can manually trigger the filename synchronization after 
editing with '`tpnote --batch "$FILE"`':
 

```sh
FILE=$(tpnote --batch) # Create the new note.
tpnote --view "$FILE"& # Launch Tp-Note's viewer.
kate "$FILE"           # Note, the prompt returns immediatly as the editor forks.
                       # After closing the editor when editing is done...
tpnote --batch "$FILE" # Synchronize the note's filename again.
```

Whereby '`FILE=$(tpnote --batch)`' creates the note file, 
'`kate "$FILE"`' opens the text editor and '`tpnote --batch "$FILE"`'
synchronizes the filename after editing. 

NB: Try to avoid forking at all cost. As mentioned above, most text editors
have a command line flag to prevent the process from forking:

 
```sh
TPNOTE_EDITOR="kate --block" tpnote
```

**Register a Flatpak Markdown editor**

[Flathub for Linux] is a cross-platform application repository that works well
with Tp-Note.  To showcase an example, we will add a Tp-Note launcher for
the _Mark Text_ Markdown text editor available as [Flatpak package]. Before
installing, make sure that you have [set up Flatpack] correctly. Then install
the application with:

[Flathub for Linux]: https://www.flathub.org/home
[Flatpak package]: https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.marktext.marktext
[set up Flatpack]: https://flatpak.org/setup/

```sh
sudo flatpak install flathub com.github.marktext.marktext
```

To test, run _Mark Text_ from the command line:

```sh
flatpak run com.github.marktext.marktext
```

Then place a Tp-Note configuration in its search path (e.g. 
'`~/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml`') with the following content:

```toml
[app_args]
unix.editor = [ [ "flatpak", "run", "com.github.marktext.marktext", ] ]
```

The structure of this variable is a list of lists. Every item in the outer list
corresponds to one entire command line launching a different text editor, here
_Marktext_. When launching, Tp-Note searches through this list until it finds an
installed text editor on the system.

Save the modified configuration file.  Next time you launch Tp-Note, the
_Mark Text_-editor will open.

**Register a console text editor running in a terminal emulator**

In this setup Tp-Note launches the terminal emulator which is configured to
launch the text editor as child process. Neither process should fork when they
start (see above).

Here, some examples you can adjust to your needs and taste:

* _Neovim_ in _Xfce4-Terminal_:

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "xfce4-terminal",
      "--disable-server",
      "-x",
      "nvim",
      "+colorscheme pablo",
      "+set syntax=markdown",
    ],
  ]
  ```

* _Helix-editor_ in _XFCE4-Terminal_:

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "xfce4-terminal",
      "--disable-server",
      "-x",
      "hx",
    ],
  ]
  ```

* _Helix_ in _LXTerminal_:

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "lxterminal",
      "--no-remote",
      "-e",
      "hx",
    ],
  ]
  ```

* _Helix_ in _Xterm_:

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "xterm",
      "-fa",
      "DejaVu Sans Mono",
      "-fs",
      "12",
      "-e",
      "hx",
    ],
  ]
  ```

* _Helix_ in _Alacritty_:

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "alacritty",
      "-e",
      "hx",
    ],
  ]
  ```

* Flatpack Helix in XFCE4 terminal

  ```toml
  [app_args]
  unix.editor = [
    [
      "xfce4-terminal", "--disable-server", "-x",
      "flatpak", "run", "com.helix_editor.Helix",
    ],
  ]
  
  unix.editor_console = [
    [
      "flatpak", "run", "com.helix_editor.Helix"
    ],
  ]
  ```



## Change the file extension for new note files

Tp-Note identifies the note's markup language by its file extension and
renders the content accordingly (see '`filename.extensions`' variable).
For example: the variable '`filename.extensions`' lists some extensions, that
are regarded as Markdown files:

```toml
[[scheme]]
name = "default"
[scheme.filename]
extensions = [
  ["txt", "ToMarkdown", "Markdown"],
  ["md", "ToMarkdown", "Markdown"],
  ["rst", "Disabled", "ReStructuredText"],
  ["htmlnote", "PassThrough", "Html"],
  ["txtnote", "Disabled", "PlainText"],
  ["adoc", "Disabled", "PlainText"],
  ["text", "ToMarkdown", "Markdown"],
  ["markdn", "ToMarkdown", "Markdown"],
  ["markdown", "ToMarkdown", "Markdown"],
]
```

The default file extension for new note files is defined as:

```toml
[base_scheme.filename]
extension_default = "md"
```

If you prefer rather the file extension '`.markdown`' for new notes, write
a configuration file with:

```toml
[base_scheme.filename]
extension_default = "markdown"
```

This modification does not change how the note file's content is interpreted -
in this case as Markdown - because both file extensions '`.md`' and 
'`.markdown`' are rendered as '`Markdown`' according to '`filename.extensions`'.



## Configure the natural language detection algorithm

When creating a new header for a new or an existing note file, a linguistic
language detection algorithm tries to determine in what natural language the
note file is authored. Depending on the context, the algorithm processes as
input: the header field '`title:`' or the first sentence of the text body.
The natural language detection algorithm is implemented as a template filter
named '`get_lang`', which is used in various Tera content templates
'`tmpl.*_content`' in Tp-Note's configuration file. The filter '`get_lang`'
is parametrized by the configuration variables '`tmpl.filter.get_lang.*`'
containing e.g. a list of ISO 639-1 encoded languages, the algorithm considers
as potential detection candidates, e.g.:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.language_candidates = [ "en", "fr", "de", "et" ]
```

As natural language detection is CPU intensive, it is advised to limit the
number of detection candidates to 5 or 6, depending on how fast your computer
is. The more language candidates you include, the longer the note file creation
takes time. As a rule of thumb, with all languages enabled the creation of new
notes can take up to 4 seconds on my computer. Nevertheless, it is possible to
enable all available detection candidates with the empty array:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.language_candidates = []
```
If the input text is usually written in one language only, set:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.mode = "Monolingual"
```

The algorithm can also search for multiple languages in the input text:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.mode = "Multilingual"
```

The language detection algorithm can be fine-tuned with:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.minimum_relative_distance = 0.3
filter.get_lang.consecutive_words_min  = 7
filter.get_lang.words_total_percentage_min = 10
```

The above parameters can reduce false positives when determining the
natural language with the '`get_lang`' filter. Setting them to 0 finds
more languages, but leads to more false positives. A higher value
enforces criteria to ignore some words when guessing the languages. The
'`minimum_relative_distance `' excludes words that appear in more than one
language. Valid values are between '`0.0`' and '`0.99`'.
'`consecutive_words_min`' sets the minimum of consecutive words in one language
to be considered. '`words_total_percentage_min`' set the minimum word count
ratio in percent a language must appear in the input text to be reported.

Once the language is detected with the '`get_lang`' filter, it passes another
filter called '`map_lang`'. This filter maps the result of '`get_lang`' -
encoded as ISO 639-1 codes - to IETF language tags. For example, '`en`' is
replaced with '`en-US`' or '`de`' with '`de-DE`'. This additional filtering
is useful, because the detection algorithm can not figure out the region code
(e.g. `-US` or `-DE`) by itself. Instead, the region code is appended in a
separate processing step. Spell checker or grammar checker like [LTeX] rely on
this region information, to work properly.

The corresponding configuration looks like this:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.language_candidates = [ "en", "fr", "de", "et" ]
filter.map_lang = [
    [ "en", "en-US", ],
    [ "de", "de-DE", ],
]
```

When the user's region setting - as reported from the operating system's
locale setting - does not exist in above list, it is automatically appended as
additional internal mapping. When the filter `map_lang` encounters a language
code for which no mapping is configured, the input language code is forwarded
as it is without modification, e.g. the input `fr` results in the output `fr`.
Subsequent entries that differ only in the region subtag, e.g.
'`['en', 'en- GB'], ['en', 'en-US']`' are ignored.

Note, that the environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION`' - if set -
takes precedence over the '`tmpl.filter.get_lang.language_candidates`' and
'`tmpl.filter.map_lang`' settings. This allows configuring the language
detection feature system-wide without touching Tp-Note's configuration file.
The following example achieves the equivalent result to the configuration
hereinabove:

```sh
TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION="en-US, fr, de-DE, et" tpnote
```

If you want to enable all language detection candidates, add the pseudo tag
'`+all`' somewhere to the list:

```sh
TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION="en-US, de-DE, +all" tpnote
```

In the above example the IETF language tags '`en-US`' and '`de-DE`' are retained
in order to configure the region codes '`US`' and '`DE`' used by the
'`map_lang`' template filter.

For debugging observe the value of '`SETTINGS`' in the debug log with:

```sh
tpnote -d trace -b
```

If wished for, you can disable Tp-Note's language detection feature:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
filter.get_lang.mode = "Disabled"
```

Like above, you can achieve the same with:

```sh
TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION="" tpnote
```



## Localize the note's front matter

Be default, the front matter variable names are printed in English when creating
new note files from templates. For example the header variable '`fm.fm_subtitle`'
is displayed as '`subtitle:`' in the note's header.

This translation relation is defined in the configuration file variable
'`scheme.tmpl.fm_var.localization`'. Consider the following 
simplified example:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
fm_var.localization = [
    ["fm_title", "title"],
    ["fm_subtitle", "subtitle"],
    ["fm_author", "author"],
    ["fm_date", "date"],
    ["fm_lang", "lang"],
    ["fm_languages", "languages"],
    ["fm_sort_tag", "sort_tag"],
    ["fm_file_ext", "file_ext"],
    ["fm_no_filename_sync", "no_filename_sync"],
    ["fm_filename_sync", "filename_sync"],
    ["fm_scheme", "scheme"],
]
```

To change the natural language of the displayed header variable names,
modify the second column of the above table. For example:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
fm_var.localization = [
    ["fm_title", "Titel"],
    ["fm_subtitle", "Untertitel"],
    ["fm_author", "Autor"],
    ["fm_date", "Datum"],
    ["fm_lang", "Sprache"],
    ["fm_languages", "Sprachen"],
    ["fm_sort_tag", "Kennzeichen"],
    ["fm_file_ext", "Dateierweiterung"],
    ["fm_no_filename_sync", "Keine_Sync"],
    ["fm_filename_sync", "Dateinamensync"],
    ["fm_scheme", "Schema"],
]
```

Keep in mind, that the templates do not change! Header variables in templates
always start with the identifier '`fm.fm_`' (cf. first column of the above
table).

The above configuration changes the localization default for all note files
in the scope of the configuration file '`tpnote.toml`'. It is also possilbe
to use header variables in different languages side by side with
schemes:

```toml
[[scheme]]
name = 'Deutsch'
[scheme.tmpl]
fm_var.localization = [
    ["fm_title", "Titel"],
    ["fm_subtitle", "Untertitel"],
    ["fm_author", "Autor"],
    ["fm_date", "Datum"],
    ["fm_lang", "Sprache"],
    ["fm_languages", "Sprachen"],
    ["fm_sort_tag", "Kennzeichen"],
    ["fm_file_ext", "Dateierweiterung"],
    ["fm_no_filename_sync", "Keine_Sync"],
    ["fm_filename_sync", "Dateinamensync"],
    ["fm_scheme", "Schema"],
]
```

This example defines an additional scheme called “Deutsch”. To use the new
scheme invoke Tp-Note with '`tpnote --scheme Deutsch`'. It creates the
following note file:

```yaml
---
Titel:        getreu
Untertitel:   Note
Autor:        Getreu
Datum:        2025-04-23
Sprache:      de-DE
Schema:       Deutsch
---

```

When you later reopen the note file with '`tpnote 20250423-getreu--Note.md`',
Tp-Note determines with the line '`Schema: Deutsch`' its scheme '`Deutsch`'.
With the help of the associated localization table above, Tp-Note translates
the keys back to the English '`fm.fm_*`' versions. 

Note, that the (de-)localization only applies to root level keys (e.g.
'`fm_foo`' in '`fm.fm_foo`'). All nested keys names (e.g. '`baz`' in
'`fm.fm_foo.baz`') are never translated.



## Change the default markup language

Tp-Note's core functionality, the management of note file headers and filenames,
is markup language agnostic. However, among the shipped templates, there is
one content template '`tmpl.annotate_file_content`' that generates a hyperlink.
As the hyperlink syntax varies depending on the markup language, Tp-Note's
default internal '`tmpl.annotate_file_content`' template, handle “Markdown” and
“ReStructuredText” syntax. If you wish to switch the default markup language
with '`filename.extension_default`' to another language than '`md`' or '`rst`',
you should not forget to modify the '`tmpl.annotate_file_content`' content
template as well.

Tp-Note's built-in viewer is not markup language agnostic. It comprises three
different markup renderers (cf. section _Customize the built-in note viewer_):

* _Markdown_ (file extension `.md`)
* _ReStructuredText_ (file extension `.rst`) and
* _PlainText_ (Link only renderer, file extension `.txtnote`) 


### Change the default markup language to ReStructuredText

Tp-Note's core function is a template system and as such it depends
very little on the used markup language. The default templates are
designed in a way that they contain almost no markup specific code. Though there
is one little exception in the '`annotate_file_content`' template (see
previous section).

When you open an existing note file, Tp-Note detects the note file's markup
language from its file extension. To open a note written in ReStructuredText
just type:

```sh
tpnote mynote.rst
```

To create a new ReStructuredText note invoke Tp-Note with:

```sh
TPNOTE_EXTENSION_DEFAULT=rst tpnote
```

You can change the Markup language of a specific note file by adding the
variable '`file_ext:`' to its YAML header. For example, for ReStructuredText
add:

```yaml
---
title:    some note
file_ext: rst
---
````

To make ReStructuredText the default markup language for all future new notes,
write a configuration file '`~/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml`' with the following
content:

```toml
[base_scheme.filename]
extension_default="rst"
```

Or, if you wish to apply the change only to notes created with the '`zettel`'
scheme set:

```toml
[[scheme]]
name = 'zettel'
[scheme.filename]
extension_default="rst"
```

The latter overwrites the '`extension_default`' variable of the '`zettel`'
scheme, but leaves the '`default`' scheme untouched.


## Change the sort tag character set

_Sort-tags_ for new notes are generated with the '`tmpl.*_filename`'
templates. Before changing the sort-tag generation scheme in these templates,
make sure to enable the right set of potential sort-tag characters. 

In the default scheme, the digits '`0`'-'`9`', all lower case letters and the
characters '`_`', '`-`', '`.`' are recognized as being part of a *sort tag*
when they appear at the beginning of a filename.  This set of characters can
be modified with the '`filename.sort_tag.extra_chars`' configuration variable.
If defined, the '`filename.sort_tag.separator`' (by default '`-`') marks the
end of a sort tag without being part of it.  In addition, one special character
'`filename.sort_tag.extra_separator`' (by default '`'`') might be inserted by
the filename template directly after the '`-`' to avoid ambiguity.



## Customize the filename synchronization scheme

The filename synchronization scheme is fully customizable through _Tp-Note's
filename templates_. To design such a custom scheme, start to set up your
synchronization rules in the '`tmpl.sync_filename`' template. Then adjust all
'`tmpl.*_filename`' templates to comply with these rules. In order to verify
your design, check that the following holds for any sequential application of
one '`tmpl.*_filename`' template followed directly by the
'`tmpl.sync_filename`' template: The latter should never change the filename
initially set up by any '`tmpl.*_filename`' template.

Secondly, make sure that in filename templates '`tmpl.*_filename`', sort-tags 
'`{{ path | file_sort_tag }}`' are never inserted directly. Instead, prepend the
_sort_tag_ with '`prepend(with_sort_tag=path|file_sort_tag)`' to the following
expression, e.g.:

    {{ fm.fm_title | sanit | prepend(with_sort_tag=path|file_sort_tag) }}

The filter '`prepend(with_sort_tag=<...>)`' decides whether to insert the
'`sort_tag.separator="-"`' and/or the '`sort_tag.extra_separator="'"`'
characters. These heuristics enable Tp-Note to identify unequivocally sort-tags
in filenames, which avoids potential cyclic filename change. Or, in other
words: the '`tmpl.sync_filname`' template must always give the same result,
even after repeated application.

To debug your '`tmpl.sync_filename`' template, create a test note file
'`test.md`' and invoke Tp-Note with '`--debug trace`' and '`--batch`':

```sh
tpnote --batch --debug trace test.md
```


## Store new note files by default in a subdirectory

When you are annotating an existing file on disk, the new note file is
placed in the same directory by default. To configure Tp-Note to
store the new note file in a subdirectory, let's say '`Notes/`', instead, you
need to modify the templates '`scheme.tmpl.annotate_file_filename`' and
'`scheme.tmpl.annotate_file_content`':

First, create a configuration file '`~/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml`' with:

```toml
[base_scheme.tmpl]
annotate_file_content = """
COMPLETE HERE
"""

annotate_file_filename = """
COMPLETE HERE
"""
```

In the above replace the string '`COMPLETE HERE`' with the default
values for the variables you obtain with '`tpnote -C - | less`'.

Then, replace in '`annotate_file_filename`' the string:

    {{ fm.fm_title | sanit | prepend(with_sort_tag=tag) }}\

with:

    Notes/{{ fm.fm_title | sanit | prepend(with_sort_tag=tag) }}\

and in '`annotate_file_content`':

    [{{ path | file_name }}](<{{ path | file_name }}>)

with:

    [{{ path | file_name }}](<../{{ path | file_name }}>)

The scheme '`zettel`' overwrites the base '`annotate_file_filename`' template.
Therefore, in case you use the '`zettel`' scheme as well, repeat the above
section and append the following to your configuration file and repeat the
above.

```toml
[[scheme]]
name = 'zettel'
[scheme.tmpl]
annotate_file_content = """
COMPLETE HERE
"""

annotate_file_filename = """
COMPLETE HERE
"""
```

To test your configuration, place a '`test.pdf`' file in the current directory
and annotate that file with:

```sh
tpnote test.pdf
```

This should create a new note file '`./Notes/test.pdf--Note.md` and open
your web browser with a link to '`test.pdf`'. Clicking on that link, the 
PDF page should be shown. The default behaviour, without this 
customization, is to create the new note file '`./test.pdf--Note.md`' in the
current directory.

To test the '`zettel`' scheme configuration invoke Tp-Note with:

```sh
tpnote -s zettel test.pdf
```


## Customize the built-in note viewer

### Change the way how note files are rendered for viewing

Currently, three markup renderers are available: '`Markdown`',
'`ReStructuredText`' and '`PlainText`'. The configuration file variable
'`filename.extensions`' associates several note file extensions with one of
these markup renderers. In case none of them suit you, it is possible to
disable the viewer feature selectively for one particular note file extension
by associating it with the pseudo '`RendererDisabled`' renderer. If you wish to
disable the viewer feature overall (for all file extensions), set the variable
'`arg_default.edit = true`'.


### Delay the launch of the web browser

By default, Tp-Note launches two external programs: some text editor and a
web browser. If wished for, the configuration variable
'`viewer.startup_delay`' allows delaying the launch of the web browser some
milliseconds.  This way the web browser window will always appear on top of the
editor window.  A negative value delays the start of the text editor instead.


### Change the HTML rendition template

After the markup rendition process, Tp-Note's built-in viewer generates its
final HTML rendition through the customizable HTML templates
'`tmpl_html.viewer`', '`tmpl_html.viewer_error`' and '`tmpl_html.exporter`'.
Unlike content templates and filename templates, all HTML templates escape HTML
critical characters in variables by default. To disable escaping for a specific
variable, add the '`safe`' filter in last position of the filter chain.
Please note, that in general, the '`safe`' filter is only recommended directly
after the '`to_html`' and the '`markup_to_html`' filters, because these
handle critical input by themselves. The following simplified code sample,
inspired by the '`tmpl_html.viewer`' template, illustrates the available
variables:

```toml
[tmpl_html]
viewer = '''
{%- set ext = fm.fm_file_ext | default(value=extension_default ) -%}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ fm.fm_lang | default(value='en') }}">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>{{ fm.fm_title }}</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ viewer_doc_css_path }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ viewer_highlighting_css_path }}">
  </head>
  <body>
  <pre class="doc-header">{{ doc_fm_text }}</pre>
  <hr>
  <div class="doc-body">
    {{ doc.body | markup_to_html(extension=ext) | safe }}
  </div>
  <script>{{ viewer_doc_js | safe }}</script>
</body>
</html>
'''
```

Specifically:

* '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`' are the deserialized header variables. Note, that the header
  variables may be localized, e.g. '`Untertitel`'. Nevertheless, in templates
  always use the English version, e.g. '`fm.fm_subtitle`'. All content
  template variables and filters are available. See section _Template
  variables_ above.

* '`{{ viewer_doc_css_path }}`' is the CSS stylesheet path required to format
  an HTML rendition of a Tp-Note document. This path is hard-wired and it is
  understood by Tp-Note's internal web server.

* '`{{ viewer_highlighting_css_path }}`' is the CSS stylesheet path required to
  highlight embedded source code. This path is hard-wired and it is understood
  by Tp-Note's internal web server.

* '`{{ doc.header }}`' is the raw UTF-8 copy of the header. Not to be
  confounded with the dictionary variable '`{{ fm }}`'.

* '`{{ doc.body | markup_to_html(extension=ext) | safe }}`' is the note's
  body as HTML rendition. The parameter '`extension`' designates the 
  markup language as specified in the '`filename.extensions-*`' variables.

* '`{{ viewer_doc_js | safe }}`' is the JavaScript browser code for live
  updates.

* '`{{ extension_default }}`' (c.f. section _Template variables_).

* '`{{ username }}`' (c.f. section _Template variables_).

* '`{{ lang }}`' (c.f. section _Template variables_).

* '`{{ my_val | to_html | safe }}`' is the HTML rendition of the '`my_val`'
  variable (c.f. section _Template filter_).

* '`{{'fm.fm_title' | name}}`' prints the localized name of the '`fm.fm_title`'
  variable, e.g. '`title`' in English or '`Titel`' in German.

Alternatively, the header enclosed by '`<pre>...</pre>`' can also be rendered
as a table:

```html
  <table class="fm">
    <tr>
    <th class="fmkey">{{'fm.fm_title' | name}}:</th>
    <th class="fmval"><b>
        {{ fm.fm_title| default(value='') | to_html | safe }}</b>
    </th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th class="fmkey">{{'fm.fm_subtitle' | name}}:</th>
    <th class="fmval">
        {{ fm.fm_subtitle | default(value='') | to_html | safe }}
    </th>
  </tr>
  {% for k, v in fm | remove(key='fm_title')|
                      remove(key='fm_subtitle')|
  %}
    <tr>
    <th class="fmkeygrey">{{ k | name }}:</th>
    <th class="fmvalgrey">{{ v | to_html | safe }}</th>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
  </table>
```

The error page template '`tmpl_html.viewer_error`' (see below)
does not provide '`fm.fm_*`' variables, because of possible header syntax
errors. Instead, the variable '`{{ doc_error }}`' contains the error
message as raw UTF-8 and the variable 
'`{{ doc_text | markup_to_html | safe }}`' the HTML rendition of the text source
with clickable hyperlinks:

```toml
[tmpl_html]
viewer_error = '''
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=\"en\">
<head>
<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">
<title>Syntax error</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Syntax error</h3>
<p> in note file: <pre>{{ path }}</pre><p>
<div class=\"note-error\">
<hr>
<pre>{{ doc_error }}</pre>
<hr>
</div>
{{ doc_text | markup_to_html | safe }}
<script>{{ viewer_doc_js | safe }}</script>
</body>
</html>
'''
```

### Customize the built-in HTML exporter

Customizing Tp-Note's HTML export function works the same way as
customizing the built-in viewer. There are some slight differences though:
The role of the '`tmpl_html.viewer`' template - discussed above - is
taken over by the '`tmpl_html.exporter`' template: 

```toml
[tmpl_html]
exporter = '''
{%- set ext = fm.fm_file_ext | default(value=extension_default ) -%}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ fm.fm_lang | default(value='en') }}">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>{{ fm.fm_title }}</title>
<style>
{{ exporter_doc_css | safe }}
{{ exporter_highlighting_css | safe }}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <pre class="doc-header">{{ doc_fm_text }}</pre>
  <hr>
  <div class="doc-body">
    {{ doc.body | markup_to_html(extension=ext) | safe }}
  </div>
</body>
</html>
'''
```

In this template the same _Tera_ variables as in '`tmpl_html.viewer`' are
available, with one exception '`{{ note_js }}`', which does not make sense
in this context. As the exporter prints possible rendition error messages on
the console, there is no equivalent to the '`tmpl_html.viewer_error`' template.
Note, in contrast to the previous '`tmpl_html.viewer`' example, the
source code highlighting CSS code is now embedded into the HTML output with:

```html
<style>
{{ exporter_doc_css | safe }}
{{ exporter_highlighting_css | safe }}
</style>
```

Note, the '`safe`' filter disables the escaping of critical characters in the
CSS input. We have no security concerns in this context, because we have full
control over the CCS input coming from the configuration file variables
'`tmpl_html.exporter_doc_css`' and '`tmpl_html.exporter_highlighting_theme`'.



## Choose your favourite web browser as note viewer

Once the note is rendered into HTML, Tp-Note's internal HTTP server connects
to a random port at the '`localhost`' interface where the rendition is served
to be viewed with a web browser. Tp-Note's configuration file contains a list
'`app_args.unix.browser`' with common web browsers and their usual
location on Unix like operating systems. For other systems consult
'`app_args.windows.browser`' and '`app_args.macos.browser`'. This list
is executed top down until a web browser is found and launched. If you
want to view your notes with a different web browser, simply overwrite the
internal '`app_args.unix.browser`' list and put your favourite web browser on 
top.

```toml
[app_args]
unix.browser = [[ "chromium", "--new-window", "--incognito"]]
```

Alternatively, you can set the '`TPNOTE_BROWSER`' environment variable (cf.
examples in the chapter _ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_ below).

In case none of the listed browsers can be found, Tp-Note switches into a
fallback mode with limited functionality, where it tries to open the system's
default web browser. A disadvantage is, that in fall back mode Tp-Note is
not able to detect when the user closes the web browser. This might lead to
situations, where Tp-Note's internal HTTP server shuts down too early. In order
to check if Tp-Note finds the selected web browser as intended, invoke Tp-Note
with '`tpnote --debug debug --popup --view`'.




# TEMPLATES

All _TP-Note_'s workflows are customizable through its templates which
are grouped in the '`[scheme.tmpl]`' and in the '`[scheme.tmpl_html]`'
section of Tp-Note's configuration file. This chapter deals with
'`[scheme.tmpl]`' templates which are responsible for generating Tp-Note files.
'`[scheme.tmpl_html]`' templates concern only Tp-Note's viewer feature and are
discussed in the chapters: Customize the built-in note viewer_ and _Choose your
favourite web browser as note viewer_.

Tp-Note captures and stores its environment in _Tera variables_. For example,
the variable '`{{ dir_path }}`' is initialized with the note's target
directory. The variable '`{{ clipboard }}`' contains the content of the
clipboard. To learn more about Tera variables, launch Tp-Note with the
'`--debug trace`' option and observe what information it captures from its
environment.



## Template types

The content of a new note is composed by one of Tp-Note's internal customizable
templates, hence the name Tp-Note, where _Tp_ stands for “template”. Which of
the internal templates is applied depends on the context in which Tp-Note is
invoked: e.g. the template when creating a new note file in a given directory is
called '`tmpl.from_dir_content`'.

In total, there are 3 different '`tmpl.*_content`' templates:

* '`tmpl.from_dir_content`'
* '`tmpl.from_text_file_content`'
* '`tmpl.annotate_file_content`'

In general, the templates are designed in a way, that the text input
stream - usually originating from the clipboard - ends up in the body of the
note file, whereas the environment - such as the username - ends up in
the header of the note file.

Once the content of the new note is set by one of the above content templates,
another template type comes into play: the so-called _filename template_.
Each content template has a corresponding filename template, e.g.:

* '`tmpl.from_dir_filename`'
* '`tmpl.from_text_file_filename`'
* '`tmpl.annotate_file_filename`'
* '`tmpl.sync_filename`' (no corresponding content template)

As the name suggests, the role of a filename template is to determine the
filename of the new note. This is done by evaluating (deserializing) it's YAML
header. The values of the note's YAML header fields are can be accessed in
filename templates through various '`{{ fm.fm_<key> }}`' dynamically created
template variables. For example the value of the YAML header field '`title:`'
can be accessed with '`{{ fm.fm_title }}`'. Once the filename is set, Tp-Note
writes out the new note on disk.

Most of the above templates are dedicated to the creation of new note files.
However, two of them have a special role: _prepend header to text file_
and _synchronize filename_:

* _Prepend header to text file_: When Tp-Note opens a regular text file
  without a YAML header, a new header is prepended automatically. It's
  data originates mainly form the filename of the text file. The templates
  applied in this use case are: '`tmpl.from_text_file_content`' and
  '`tmpl.from_text_file_filename`'.

* _Synchronize filename_: This function mode is invoked when [Tp-Note] opens an
  existing note file, after it's YAML header is evaluated. The extracted header
  information is then applied to the '`tmpl.sync_filename`' template and the
  resulting filename is compared to the actual filename on disk. If they
  differ, [Tp-Note] renames the note file. Note, the '`tmpl.sync_filename`'
  template operates on its own without a corresponding content template.

Note, that in the operation mode _synchronize filename_, the header data
overwrites the filename of the note, whereas in the operation mode _prepend
header_ the filename data is copied into the new prepended header. Keep in mind,
that even in the latter mode the filename might change slightly. This is because
after the header creation with the '`tmpl.from_text_file_content`' template,
the '`tmpl.from_text_file_filename`' template is applied, which might cause a
slight filename modification due to its sanitization filters (cf. '`sanit()`'
in the section _Template filters_).

You can disable the _prepend header_ feature by setting the configuration file
variable '`arg_default.add_header = false`'. To disable all filename
synchronization, set '`arg_default.no_filename_sync = true`'. This guarantees,
that Tp-Note will never change neither the filename nor the YAML header of an
existing file.

For a more detailed description of templates and their defaults, please
consult the '`const`' definitions in Tp-Note's source code files
'`config.rs`' and '`note.rs`' in the directory '`tpnote-lib/src/`'.



## Template variables

All [Tera template variables and functions
](https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#templates) can be used within Tp-Note's
templates. For example '`{{ get_env(name='LANG') }}'` gives you access to the
'`LANG`' environment variable.

In addition, Tp-Note defines the following variables:

* '`{{ path }}`' is the canonicalized fully qualified path name corresponding
  to Tp-Note's positional command line parameter '`<path>`'. If none was
  given on the command line, '`{{ path }}`' contains the current working
  directory path.

* '`{{ dir_path }}`' is identical to '`{{ path }}`' with one exception: if
  '`{{ path }}`' points to a file, the last component (the file name) is omitted
  and only the directory path is retained. If '`{{ path }}`' points to a
  directory, '`{{ dir_path }}`' equals '`{{ path }}`'.

* '`{{ doc_fm_text }}`': is the header as raw text of the file '`{{ path }}`'
  points to.  Note, this variable is only available in the templates
  '`from_text_file_*`', '`sync_filename`' and the HTML templates below.

* '`{{ doc.body }}`': is the content of the file '`{{ path }}`'
  points to. If the file starts with a YAML header, its raw text is stored
  in '`{{ doc.header }}`'. Note, these variables are only available in the
  templates: '`from_text_file_content`', '`sync_filename`' and in the HTML
  templates '`tmpl_html.*`'.

* '`{{ doc_file_date }}`': is the file system creation date of the file
  '`{{ path }}`' points to. This variable is only available in the
  templates '`from_text_file_*`', '`sync_filename`' and in HTML templates.
  This condition implies, that '`{{ path }}`' points to a file.
  Note: on some platforms and with some filesystems, the variable 
  '`{{ doc_file_date }}`' might not be available. Here the file modification
  date is used instead.

* '`{{ txt_clipboard.body }}`' is the complete '`plain/text`' clipboard text.
  In case the clipboard's content starts with a YAML header, only the non YAML
  content is retained. '`{{ txt_clipboard.header }}`' is the YAML header section
  of the clipboard data, if it exists. If not, the variable is empty.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body }}`' and '`{{ html_clipboard.header }}`' contain the
  same text as their '`txt_clipboard.*`' counterparts, but as HTML. The
  HTML clipboard provides more information, e.g. hyperlinks contain a link
  destination besides its link text. In the TXT clipboard you see only link
  texts.

* '`{{ stdin.body }}`' is the complete text content originating from the input
  stream '`stdin`'. This stream can replace the clipboard when it is not
  available.  In case the input stream's content starts with a YAML header,
  the latter does not appear in this variable. '`{{ stdin.header }}`' is the
  YAML section of the input stream, if one exists. Otherwise, the variable
  is still defined, but its value is the empty string.

* '`{{ extension_default }}`' is the default extension for new notes
  (can be changed in the configuration file),

* '`{{ username }}`' is the content of the first non-empty environment
  variable: '`TPNOTE_USER`', '`LOGNAME`', '`USER`' or '`USERNAME`'.

* '`{{ lang }}`' contains the user's language tag as defined in
  [RFC 5646](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt).
  Not to be confused with the UNIX '`LANG`' environment variable from which
  this value is derived under Linux/macOS.
  Under Windows, the user's language tag is queried through the WinAPI.
  If defined, the environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG`' overwrites the value
  of '`{{ lang }}`' (all operating systems).

The following '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`' variables are typically generated, _after_ a
content template was filled in with data: For example a field named '`title:`'
in the content template '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' will generate the variable
'`fm.fm_title`' which can then be used in the corresponding
'`tmpl.from_dir_filename`' filename template. '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`' variables are
generated dynamically. This means, a YAML front-matter variable '`foo:`' in a
note will generate a '`{{ fm.fm_foo }}`' template variable. On the other hand, a
missing '`foo:`' will cause '`{{ fm.fm_foo }}`' to be undefined.
Please note, that the header variables may be localized, e.g. '`Untertitel:`'.
Nevertheless, in templates always use the English version, e.g.
'`fm.fm_subtitle`'.

It is to be observed that '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`' variables are not available in  in
the '`tmpl.from_text_file_content`' content template.

* '`{{ fm.fm_title }}`' is the '`title:`' as indicated in the YAML front-matter
  of the note.

* '`{{ fm.fm_subtitle }}`' is the '`subtitle:`' as indicated in the YAML front
  matter of the note.

* '`{{ fm.fm_author }}`' is the '`author:`' as indicated in the YAML
  front-matter of the note.

* '`{{ fm.fm_lang }}`' is the '`lang:`' as indicated in the YAML front-matter of
  the note.

* '`{{ fm.fm_file_ext }}`' holds the value of the optional YAML header variable
  '`file_ext:`' (e.g. '`file_ext: rst`').

* '`{{ fm.fm_sort_tag }}`': The sort tag variable as defined in the YAML front
  matter of this note (e.g. '`sort_tag: '20200312'`').

* '`{{ fm }}`': is a collection (map) of all defined '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`'
  variables.  It is used in the '`tmpl.from_dir_content`' template,
  typically in a loop like:

  ```tera
  {{ fm.fm_title | to_yaml(key='fm_title') }}
  {{ fm.fm_subtitle | to_yaml(key='fm_subtitle') }}
  {{ fm  | remove(key='fm_title') | remove(key='fm_keywords') | to_yaml }}
  ```

Important: there is no guarantee, that any of the above '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`'
variables are defined! Depending on the last content template result, certain
variables might be undefined. Please take into consideration, that a defined
variable might contain the empty string '`''`'. Creating a new note file
with a content template, the note's header is parsed into '`{{ fm.fm_* }}`'
variables. The latter are then type checked according configurable rules.
The rules are defined in '`tmpl.filter.assert_precondition`'

For a more detailed description of the available template variables, please
consult the '`const`' definitions in Tp-Note's source code file '`note.rs`'.



## Template filters

In addition to _Tera_'s [built-in
filters](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#built-in-filters), Tp-Note comes with
some additional filters, i.e.: 
'`append(newline=true)`', '`append(with=...)`', '`trunc`',
'`file_copy_counter`', '`file_ext`', '`file_name`', '`file_sort_tag`',
'`file_stem`', '`flatten_array`', '`get_lang`', '`heading`', '`html_heading`',
'`html_to_markup(extension=..., default=...)`', '`insert(key=..., value=...)`',
'`link_dest`', '`link_text`', '`link_title`', '`map_lang`', '`prepend`',
'`prepend(newline=true)`', '`prepend(with=...)`',
'`prepend(with_sort_tag=...)`', '`remove(key=)`', '`replace_empty(with=...)`',
'`sanit`', '`to_html`', '`to_yaml`', '`to_yaml(key=...)`', '`to_yaml(tab=...)`'
and '`trim_file_sort_tag`'.

A filter is always used together with a variable. Here are some examples:

* '`{{ path | file_name }}`' returns the final component of '`{{ path }}`'.
  If '`{{ path }}`' points to a file, the filter returns the complete filename
  including its sort tag, stem, copy-counter, dot and extension. If the
  '`<path>`' points to a directory, the filter returns the final directory name.

* '`{{ path | file_sort_tag }}`' is the sort tag (numerical filename prefix) of
  the final component of '`{{ path }}`', e.g. '`01-23_9`' or '`20191022`'. It
  is similar to '`{{ path | file_name }}`' but without returning its stem,
  copy-counter and extension.

* '`{{ path | file_sort_tag | assert_valid_sort_tag }}`' does not change 
  the above output, but the filter asserts at runtime, that the resulting type
  is either '`String`' or '`Number`' and that all characters are part of the set
  '`filename.sort_tag.extra_chars`'. The additional runtime check simplifies
  template debugging. 

* '`{{ path | file_stem }}`' is similar to '`{{ path | file_name }}`'
  but without its sort tag, copy-counter and extension. Only the stem of
  '`{{ path }}`''s last component is returned.

* '`{{ path | file_copy_counter }}`' is similar to '`{{ path | file_name }}`'
  but without its sort tag, stem and extension. Only the copy counter of
  '`{{ path }}`''s last component is returned.

* '`{{ path | file_ext }}`' is '`{{ path }}`'’s file extension without
  dot (period), e.g. '`txt`' or '`md`'.

* '`{{ path | file_ext | prepend(with='.') }}`' is '`{{ path }}`'’s file
  extension with dot (period), e.g. '`.txt`' or '`.md`'.

* '`{{ path | trim_file_sort_tag }}`' returns the final component of '`path`'
  which might be a directory name or a file name. Unlike the '`file_name`'
  filter (which also returns the final component), '`trim_file_sort_tag`' trims
  the sort tag if there is one.

* '`{{ dir_path | find_last_created_file | incr_sort_tag(default="") }}`'
  searches '`dir_path`' for the most recently created Tp-Note file, extracts
  the sort-tag from its file name and increments it. If the incremented
  sort-tag (e.g. '`13`') exists on disk in the note's directory already,
  the incrementation is performed by "branching" instead (e.g. '`12a`').
  If the incrementation fails, for example because the input sort-tag is a
  chronological sort-tag type or because it is empty, the '`default`' value is
  returned.

* '`{{ dir_path | trim_file_sort_tag }}`' returns the final component
  of '`dir_path`' (which is the final directory name in '`{{ path }}`').
  Unlike the '`file_name`' filter (which also returns the final component),
  '`trim_file_sort_tag`' trims the sort tag if there is one.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body | html_to_markup(extension=e, default=d) }}`'
  converts the clipboard's HTML content into the target markup language
  specified by '`{{ e }}`', e.g. '`md`'. If the conversion fails or results in
  an empty string, stream the content of the variable '`{{ d }}`' instead.

* '`{{ txt_clipboard.body | trunc }}`' is the first 200 bytes from the
  clipboard.

* '`{{ txt_clipboard.body | heading }}`' is the clipboard's content until the
  end of the first sentence, or the first newline.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body | html_heading }}`' searches in the HTML clipboard
  input, for e.g '`<h2>HEADING</h2>`', and returns the first HTML heading, e.g. 
  '`HEADING`'.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body | link_text }}`' is the name of the first Markdown or
  ReStructuredText formatted link in the clipboard.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body | link_dest }}`' is the URL of the first Markdown or
  ReStruncturedText formatted link in the clipboard.

* '`{{ html_clipboard.body | link_title }}`' is the title of the first Markdown
  or ReStruncturedText formatted link in the clipboard.

* '`{{ username | capitalize | to_yaml(key='author',tab=12) }}`' is the
  capitalized YAML encoded username. As all YAML front-matter is YAML encoded,
  the '`to_yaml`' filter must be appended to any template variable placed
  in the front-matter block. The '`key='author'`' parameter prepends the
  key to the capitalized username, e.g.: '`autor:      John`'. Note, the
  first letter of '`John`' starts at the tabulator position '`tab=12`'.

* '`{{ fm.fm_subtitle | sanit }}`' is the note's subtitle as defined in its front
  matter, sanitized in a file system friendly form. Special characters are
  omitted or replaced by '`-`' and '`_`'. See the section _Filename template
  convention_ for more details about this filter.

* '`{{ fm.fm_title | sanit | prepend(with_sort_tag=path|file_sort_tag) }}`'
  is the note's title as defined in its front-matter. Same as above,
  but the title string is prepended with the note's _sort_tag_ and with a
  '`filename.sort_tag.separator`' (by default '`-`'). Eventually, a second
  '`filename.sort_tag.extra_separator`' (by default '`''`') is inserted
  after the first to guarantee, that one of the separators unequivocally
  marks the end of the _sort_tag_. This might be necessary to avoid ambiguity
  in case the '`fm.fm_title`' starts with a character defined in the
  '`filename.sort_tag.extra_chars`' set.

* '`{{ fm.title | replace_empty(with='no title')`' forwards the input unchanged. 
  In case the input is the empty string, the '`with`' string is forwarded 
  instead.

* '`{{ fm | remove(key='fm_title') | remove(key='fm_author') | to_yaml }}`'
  renders the collection (map) '`fm`', exclusive of the
  variables '`fm.fm_title`' and '`fm.fm_author`' to YAML. Note, that the filter
  '`to_yaml`' has no parameter '`key`' in this context.

* '`{{ fm | insert(key='fm_author', value='Getreu') | to_yaml}}`' takes
  the collection (map) '`fm`', inserts the key/value '`fm_author`'/'`Jens`'
  and renders the result into YAML. Note, that the filter '`to_yaml`' has no
  parameter '`key`' in this context.

* '`{{ fm | to_yaml | append(newline=true) }}`' 
  renders the collection (map) '`fm`' into YAML. If the collection is empty,
  the result is the empty string. Otherwise, the YAML rendition is appended with
  a newline character.

* '`{{ fm | to_html | safe }}`' renders the collection (map) '`fm.fm_*`' 
  into HTML. The '`to_html`' must be followed by a '`safe`' filter to pass
  through the HTML formatting of objects and arrays.

* '`{{ doc.body | get_lang }}`' determines the natural
  languages of the text in the variable '`{{ doc.body }}` and returns
  the result as an array of ISO 639-1 language codes. The template filter
  '`{{ get_lang }}`' can be configured with the configuration file variable
  '`tmpl.filter.get_lang`'. The latter defines those ISO 639-1 codes, the
  detection algorithm considers as potential language candidates. Keep this list
  as small as possible, because language detection is computationally expensive.
  A long candidate list may slow down the note file creation workflow. The
  detected languages are listed as `'Value::Array`' in the order of their
  statistic frequency. If the detection algorithm can not detect any of the
  configured language candidates, the filter '`{{ get_lang }}`' returns en empty
  array.

* '`{{ doc.body | get_lang | map_lang }}`': The '`map_lang`'
  filter extends the detected ISO 638-1 language codes to complete IETF
  BCP 47 language tags, usually containing a region subtag. For example
  the input '`en`' results in '`en-US`'. This additional mapping is useful
  because the detection algorithm can not determine the region automatically.
  The mapping can be configured by adjusting the configuration file
  variable '`tmpl.filter.map_lang`'. If a language is not listed in the
  '`tmpl.filter.map_lang`' filter configuration, the input is passed through,
  e.g. '`fr`' results in '`fr`'.

* '`{{ doc.body | get_lang | map_lang(default=lang) }}`' adds an
  extra mapping to the '`map_lang`' filter: when the input of the '`map_lang`'
  filter is an empty `Value::Array`, then '`{{ lang }}`' is added as single
  item. '`{{ lang }}`' is expected to be a ISO 638-1 language code, e.g. '`en`'.
  Depending on the '`tmpl.filter.map_lang`' configuration, the exemplary
  '`en`' input may be converted to '`en-US`' or '`en-GB`'.

* '`{{ doc.body | get_lang | ... | flatten_array | to_yaml }}`':
  Arrays are usually printed with '`to_yaml`' as item lists. When a list
  contains exactly one item, the filter '`flatten_array`' flattens that list.
  This way the single item is printed as such and not as a list with only one
  item. Lists with two or more items are not flattened. They are passed through
  without modification.

* '`{{ doc.body | get_lang | ... | first | to_yaml }}`' returns the
  language with the biggest word count frequency as '`Value::String`'.

* '`{{ doc_file_date | default(value=now()) | date(format='%Y%m%d') }}`'
  Returns the formatted date of the file '`{{ path }}`' points to. Defaults
  to the current date in cases '`{{ doc_file_date }}`' is not defined (see
  _Template variables_ section).



## Content template conventions

Tp-Note distinguishes two template types: content templates are used to create
the note's content (front-matter and body) and the corresponding
filename templates '`tmpl.*_filename`' are used to calculate the note's
filename.  By convention, content templates appear in the configuration file in
variables named '`tmpl.*_content`'.

Strings in the front matter section of content templates are YAML encoded.
Therefore, all variables used in the front-matter must pass an additional
'`to_yaml()`'-filter. For example, the variable
'`{{ dir_path | file_stem() }}`' becomes
'`{{ dir_path | file_stem() | to_yaml(key='title') }}`' or, shorter:
'`{{ dir_path | file_stem | to_yaml(key='title') }}`'.

When given with a key, the '`to_yaml(key='...')`' filter accepts any input
type, whereas the short form '`to_yaml()`' requires an '`Value::Object`'
type as input. The latter is often followed be the '`append(newline=true)`'
filter appending a newline.



## Filename template conventions

By convention, filename templates appear in the configuration file in variables
named '`tmpl.*_filename`'.  When a content template creates a new note, the
corresponding filename template is called afterwards to calculate the filename
of the new note. Please note that, the filename template
'`tmpl.sync_filename`' has a special role as it synchronizes the filename
of existing note files. Besides this, as we are dealing with filenames we must
guarantee, that the filename templates produce only file system friendly
characters.  For this purpose Tp-Note provides the additional Tera filter
'`sanit`':

The '`sanit()`' filter transforms a string in a file system friendly from.
This is done by replacing forbidden characters like '`?`' and '`\\`' with
'`_`' or space. This filter can be used with any variable, but is most useful
with filename templates. For example, in the '`tmpl.sync_filename`' template,
we find the expression '`{{ subtitle | sanit }}`'. Note that the filter
recognizes strings that represent a so-called dot file name and treats them a
little differently by prepending them with an apostrophe: a dot file is a file
whose name starts with '`.`' and that does not contain whitespace. It may or
may not end with a file extension. The apostrophe preserves the following dot
from being filtered.

The '`prepend(with_sort_tag=<...>`' filter is similar to the 
'`prepend(with=<...>`' filter, with two exceptions:

1. If '`filename.sort_tag.separator`' is defined (by default '`-`'), it is 
   automatically inserted between the sort-tag and the input string.
2. In some cases an additional separator 
   '`filename.sort_tag.extra_separator`' (by default '`'`') may be inserted 
   as well.

Both separators guarantee that the end of a sort-tag is detected
unequivocally. For example, when the input string starts with a digit
'`0123456789`' or '`-_ `', the string is prepended with `-'`, e.g.
'`1-The Show Begins`' becomes '`'1-The Show Begins`'.
The '`prepend(with_sort_tag=<...>)`' filter must be applied to the first
variable, e.g. 
'`{{ fm.fm_title | sanit | prepend(with_separator=path|file_sort_tag )}`'. 
This way, it is always possible to univocally distinguish the sort-tag from the
rest of the filename. Note, the default sort-tag separators can be changed with
the configuration variables
'`filename.sort_tag.separator`' and '`filename.sort_tag.extra_separator`'. For
more details please consult the _Customize the filename synchronization scheme_
chapter.

In filename templates most variables must pass the '`sanit`' filter.  Exception
to this rule are sort-tag expressions like '`{{ path | file_sort_tag }}`' and
'`{{ dir_path | file_sort_tag }}`'. As the latter are guaranteed to contain only
the file system friendly characters '`0123456789 -_`', no additional filtering
is required. Please note, that in this case a '`sanit`'-filter would needlessly
restrict the value range of sort-tags because they may contain characters, 
which the '`sanit`'-filter screens out when they appear in leading
or trailing position. For this reason one must not use the '`sanit`'-filter
together with '`{{ path | file_sort_tag }}`' or 
'`{{ dir_path |file_sort_tag }}`'.




# SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

As discussed above, Tp-Note's built-in viewer sets up an HTTP server on the
'`localhost`' interface with a random port number.

For security reasons, Tp-Note limits the set of files the viewer is
able to publish. To summarize, a file is only served:

1. When it is referenced in one of the currently viewed Tp-Note files,
2. when its file extension is registered with the '`viewer.served_mime_type`'
   list,
3. if the number of so far viewed Tp-Note files,
   '`viewer.displayed_tpnote_count_max`' is not exceeded,
4. when it's located under a directory containing a marker file named
   '`tpnote.toml`' (without marker file this condition is void).

The HTTP server runs as long as the launched web browser window is open.
Note, that the server not only exposes the displayed note file, but also all
referenced inline images and other linked TP-Note files. Internally, the
viewer maintains a list of _referenced local URLs_. For security reasons,
only listed files are served. To limit data exfiltration in case an attacker
gains access to an account on your machine, the number of served Tp-Note files
is limited by the configurable value '`viewer.displayed_tpnote_count_max`'.

In addition to the above quantitative restriction, Tp-Note's built-in viewer
serves only files whose file extensions are registered with the
'`viewer.served_mime_type`' configuration file variable.  The latter allows
disabling the _follow links to other Tp-Note files_ feature by removing all
'`text/*`' mime types from that list.

Another security feature is the '`tpnote.toml`' marker file. When Tp-Note
opens a note file, it checks all directories above, one by one, until it
finds the marker file '`tpnote.toml`'. Tp-Note's viewer will never serve a file
located outside the root directory and its children. When no '`tpnote.toml`'
file is found, the root directory is set to '`/`', which disables this
security feature.

As Tp-Note's built-in viewer binds to the '`localhost`' interface, the exposed
files are in principle accessible to all processes running on the computer. As
long as only one user is logged into the computer at a given time, no privacy
concern is raised: any potential attacker must be logged in, in order to access
the `localhost` HTTP server.

This is why on systems where multiple users are logged in at the same time,
it is recommended to disable Tp-Note's internal HTTP server by setting the
configuration file variable '`arg_default.edit = true`'. Alternatively, you
can also compile Tp-Note without the '`viewer`' feature. Note, that even if
the viewer feature disabled, the '`--export`' command line option still works:
This allows the authorized user to render the note to HTML manually.

**Summary**: As long as Tp-Note's built-in note viewer is running, the note
file and all its referenced (image) files are exposed to all users logged into
the computer at that given time. This concerns only local users, Tp-Note
never exposes any information to the network or on the Internet.




# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

LANG

>   Tp-Note stores the user's locale settings - originating from the
    environment variable '`LANG`' (or the Windows registry) - in the template
    variable '`{{ lang }}`'. When the environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG`' is
    set, it overwrites the locale setting stored in '`{{ lang }}`'.
    '`man locale`' describes the data format of '`LANG`', a typical value
    is '`en_GB.UTF-8`'.

TPNOTE\_CONFIG

>   When set, the environment variable replaces the default path where Tp-Note
    loads or stores its configuration file. It has the same effect as the
    command line option '`--config`'. If both are present, that latter takes
    precedence.

TPNOTE\_LANG

>   Tp-Note stores the user's locale settings - originating from the environment
    variable '`LANG`' (or the Windows registry) - in the template variable
    '`{{ lang }}`'. When the environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG`' is set, it
    overwrites the locale setting stored in '`{{ lang }}`'. Unlike '`LANG`', the
    environment variable '`TPNOTE_LANG`' is encoded as IETF BCP 47 language tag,
    e.g. '`en-US`'.

TPNOTE\_LANG\_DETECTION

>   If set, this variable overwrites the configuration file variables
    '`tmpl.filter.get_lang`' and '`tmpl.filter.map_lang`', thus selecting
    potential language candidates for Tp-Note's natural language detection. The
    string contains a comma and space separated list of ISO 63901 codes, e.g.
    '`fr`' or IETF BCP 47 tags, e.g. '`fr-FR`'. Here is an example of a complete
    string: '`de-DE, en, fr-FR, hu`'. The user's default locale '`{{ lang }}`'
    is automatically added to the list. Note, that the language detection
    algorithm determines only the language subtag, e.g. '`en`'. The region
    subtag will be added as indicated in your configuration. Subsequent entries
    that differ only in the region subtag, e.g. '`en-GB, en-US`' are ignored.

>   The empty string disables the automatic language detection.

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION="" tpnote
>   ```

>   For debugging observe the value of '`SETTINGS`' in the debug log:

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_LANG_DETECTION="de-DE, en, fr-FR" tpnote -d trace -b
>   ```

TPNOTE\_BROWSER

>   If set, this variable take precedence over the configuration file
    variable '`app_args.browser`'.  While the latter is a list describing
    how to invoke various web browsers, '`TPNOTE_BROWSER`' contains a string
    invoking one particular browser, exactly as one would do in a shell:
    the whitespace separated tokens list contains: the path name of the
    application, and all its flags and options. For example:

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_BROWSER="chromium --new-window --incognito" tpnote
>   ```

>   The above instructs Tp-Note to start the web browser '`chromium`' with the
    flags '`--new-window`' and '`--incognito`'. Unlike in a shell, the
    backslash and quote characters have no special meaning. Instead, all tokens
    are _percent encoded_, e.g. '`my path`' becomes '`my%20path`'.

>   The empty string disables the launch of the browser the same way
    as '`--edit`':

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_BROWSER="" tpnote
>   ```

>   is equivalent to:

>   ```sh
>   tpnote --edit
>   ```

TPNOTE\_EDITOR

>   If set, and you are working on a graphical desktop, this variable
    takes precedence over the configuration file variable '`app_args.editor`'.
    While the latter is a list describing how to invoke various file editors,
    '`TPNOTE_EDITOR`' contains a string invoking one particular file editor,
    exactly as one would do on a shell: the whitespace separated tokens list
    contains: the path name of the application, and all its flags and options.
    For example:

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_EDITOR="geany -sim" tpnote
>   ```

>   The above instructs Tp-Note to start the editor '`geany`' with the
    flags '`-sim`'. Unlike with shell tokens, the backslash and
    quote characters have no special meaning. Instead, all tokens
    are _percent encoded_. Consider the following example where
    the space character is expressed as '`%20`':

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_EDITOR="geany -sim -c ~/my%20config/" tpnote
>   ```

>   The empty string disables the launch of the editor the same way
    as the command line option '`--view`' does:

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_EDITOR="" tpnote
>   ```

>   is equivalent to:

>   ```sh
>   tpnote --view
>   ```

TPNOTE\_EDITOR\_CONSOLE

>   If set, and you are working on a virtual console, this variable takes
    precedence over the configuration file variable '`app_args.editor_console`',
    which defines the command line parameters for invoking a terminal based text
    editor, such as Emacs, Vim or Helix. Otherwise, the syntax and the operation
    are the same as with '`TPNOTE_EDITOR` hereinabove'. For example:

>   ```sh
>   sudo TPNOTE_EDITOR_CONSOLE="nvim" tpnote
>   ```

TPNOTE\_EXTENSION\_DEFAULT

>   If set, this variable takes precedence over the configuration file
    variable '`filename.extension_default`', which defines the file extension
    of new note files. In order to activate the appropriate markup renderer
    make sure, that the value given here is listed in 
    '`filename.extensions`'.
>
>   For example, to create a new reStructuredText note file type:

>   ```sh
>   TPNOTE_EXTENSION_DEFAULT=rst" tpnote
>   ```

>   Common values are: '`md`' (default, Markdown), '`txt`' (Markdown),
    '`rst`' (reStructuredText) and '`txtnote`' (text with hyperlinks).

TPNOTE_SCHEME

>   If set, this variable takes precedence over the configuration file
    variable '`arg_default.scheme`', which defines the scheme used when
    creating new note file.

TPNOTE\_USER, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME

>   The template variable '`{{ username }}`' is the content of the first
    non-empty environment variable: '`TPNOTE_USER`', '`LOGNAME`',
    '`USER`' or '`USERNAME`'.



# EXIT STATUS

The exit status is '`0`' when the note file was processed without
error or '`1`' otherwise. If Tp-Note can not read or write its
configuration file, the exit status is '`5`'.

When '`tpnote -n -b <FILE>`' returns the code '`0`', the note file has a
valid YAML header with a '`title:`' field. In addition, when
'`tpnote -n -b -x - <FILE>`' returns the code '`0`', the note's body was
rendered without error.
